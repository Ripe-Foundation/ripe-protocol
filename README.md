## Security / Responsible Disclosure

If you find a bug, vulnerability, or anything that could put user funds at risk, please report it **privately**.

- **Email:** ripefinance@proton.me (include **"SECURITY"** in the subject).
- **What to include:** clear description, impact / severity, reproducible steps or PoC, affected contract addresses + chain(s), relevant tx hashes or block numbers, and how we can reach you (e.g., GitHub handle, ENS, email, wallet for potential thanks).
- **Please do not:** exploit funds, run non-trivial mainnet attacks, or share details publicly until we’ve confirmed a fix or given written approval to disclose.
- **Ack & follow‑up:** we’ll acknowledge as quickly as we can and keep you updated through remediation.
- **Researcher Thanks (RIPE Tokens):** qualifying responsibly disclosed issues may receive a discretionary allocation of **RIPE** tokens as a thank‑you. We’re a startup with a limited budget (No VCs); awards will be modest, scaled by severity/impact, and subject to token availability, lockups, and all applicable laws/regulations. We’ll discuss details with you after triage.

Thank you for helping keep Ripe protocol safe for everyone!
