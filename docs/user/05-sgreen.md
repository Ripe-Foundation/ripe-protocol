# Savings GREEN (sGREEN)

sGREEN is yield-bearing GREEN that automatically grows in value through protocol revenues. Think of it as GREEN in a savings account that earns interest without any action required.

## How sGREEN Works

### Core Mechanism

sGREEN uses a share-based system:
- 1 sGREEN always represents at least 1 GREEN
- The exchange rate only goes up as revenues flow in
- Your sGREEN balance stays the same, but its value increases
- Redeem for GREEN anytime with no penalties

**Example**: If the rate is 1.05, your 100 sGREEN = 105 GREEN

### Where Yield Comes From

Protocol revenues automatically flow to sGREEN holders:
1. **Interest payments** from borrowers
2. **Daowry fees** (0.5% on new loans)
3. **Protocol liquidation fees** (only when sGREEN deposited in stability pools)

No staking, no claiming - just hold and earn.

## Getting sGREEN

### Option 1: Convert GREEN
- Deposit GREEN into the sGREEN vault
- Receive sGREEN at current exchange rate
- If rate is 1.1: 110 GREEN â†’ 100 sGREEN

### Option 2: Borrow Directly
- Take loans directly as sGREEN instead of GREEN
- Start earning yield immediately on borrowed funds
- Smart if sGREEN yield > your borrowing rate

## Using sGREEN

### Basic Holding
Just hold it. That's it. Your sGREEN automatically captures all protocol revenues through exchange rate appreciation.

### Stability Pool Participation
Deposit sGREEN in stability pools for multiple revenue streams:
- **Base yield**: sGREEN appreciation continues
- **Liquidation profits**: Buy collateral at 5-15% discounts
- **RIPE rewards**: Earn from Stakers category

### Liquidity Provision
Pair sGREEN with GREEN for optimal LP positions:
- Minimal impermanent loss (correlated assets)
- Earn trading fees on top of sGREEN yield
- Highly stable pair dynamics

## Key Properties

### Always Liquid
- Redeem for GREEN instantly
- No lock-ups or waiting periods
- No exit fees or penalties
- Full ERC-20 transferability

### Monotonic Growth
The exchange rate can only increase or stay the same - never decrease. Protocol design ensures your sGREEN always represents at least its initial GREEN value.

### Tax Efficiency
Value accrues through price appreciation rather than distributions, potentially simplifying tax treatment (varies by jurisdiction).

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the typical yield?**
A: Varies with protocol activity - more borrowing and liquidations = higher yield

**Q: Can I lose money holding sGREEN?**
A: No. The exchange rate never decreases. You always get at least 1 GREEN per sGREEN.

**Q: Should I borrow GREEN or sGREEN?**
A: Borrow sGREEN if you want immediate yield exposure. Borrow GREEN if you need immediate liquidity.

**Q: What happens in emergencies?**
A: sGREEN maintains full GREEN backing. Emergency mechanisms protect the underlying vault.

## Summary

sGREEN transforms idle GREEN into productive capital through automatic yield generation. Hold it for passive income, use it in stability pools for enhanced returns, or leverage it across DeFi - all while maintaining full liquidity and capital preservation.
