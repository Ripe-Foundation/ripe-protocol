# Ripe Bonds: Trade Cash for Power

Every protocol needs capital. Most just sell tokens and spend it.

Ripe bonds transform your capital into permanent treasury assets. Your USDC doesn't get spent on salaries or marketing—it becomes protocol-owned liquidity in the [Endaoment](11-endaoment.md), earning yield that backs [GREEN](01-green-stablecoin.md) forever. Lock for 3 years? Triple your allocation. Have activity boosters? Multiply it again.

The longer everyone else waits, the more you accumulate.

You're not funding an exit. You're funding a machine that prints money for the protocol—and getting a piece of the action.

## The Bond Value Proposition

### Why Bonds Matter

Bonds solve a critical challenge in DeFi: how to bootstrap protocol-owned liquidity without relying on mercenary capital or unsustainable incentives. Through bonds, Ripe Protocol:

- **Accumulates permanent treasury assets** that generate yield forever
- **Creates deep liquidity** for GREEN trading without renting it
- **Distributes RIPE fairly** based on actual capital contribution
- **Aligns incentives** between token holders and protocol health

Every bond purchase directly strengthens the protocol while rewarding participants with discounted RIPE tokens.

## Bond Mechanics: How It Works

### Epoch-Based Distribution

Bonds operate through time-limited epochs that ensure sustainable token distribution:

- **Fixed Supply Per Epoch**: Limited RIPE available prevents oversupply
- **Time Windows**: Each epoch runs 12-24 hours typically
- **Fair Access**: First-come, first-served within each epoch
- **Auto-Renewal**: New epochs can start automatically after sell-out

This system prevents whales from capturing entire allocations while ensuring consistent availability for all participants.

### Dynamic Pricing That Rewards Action

Within each epoch, RIPE prices follow a descending curve:

```
Start of Epoch → Higher Price → Less RIPE per Dollar
                      ↓
                 Time Passes
                      ↓
End of Epoch → Lower Price → More RIPE per Dollar
```

This creates interesting dynamics:

- **Early birds** get certainty of availability
- **Patient buyers** receive better prices
- **Market forces** determine actual demand
- **Transparent pricing** visible to all participants

### Token Allocation

**150 million RIPE** (15% of total supply) allocated to bonding is expected to be distributed over approximately 5 years, ensuring sustainable treasury growth without overwhelming the market. This measured approach allows the protocol to build substantial reserves while maintaining healthy token economics.

## Maximizing Your Bond Value

### Base Bond Rate

Every bond starts with a base exchange rate determined by:

- **Current epoch progress** (0-100%)
- **Price range** set by governance
- **Payment asset** (typically USDC)

The smart contract calculates your exact RIPE allocation based on these parameters, ensuring transparent and predictable pricing.

### Lock Duration Bonuses

Committing to lock your RIPE dramatically increases your bond value through percentage-based bonuses:

**The Lock Bonus Scale:**

```
No Lock → 0% bonus → 1x RIPE (base amount only)
3 Months → ~15% bonus → 1.15x total RIPE
6 Months → ~35% bonus → 1.35x total RIPE
1 Year → ~65% bonus → 1.65x total RIPE
2 Years → ~130% bonus → 2.3x total RIPE
3 Years → 200% bonus → 3x total RIPE
```

**How It Works:**

- Choose your lock duration when bonding (0 to 3 years)
- Bonus calculated as percentage of base bond amount
- Locked RIPE automatically deposits into [Ripe Governance Vault](08-governance.md)
- Start earning governance points and staking rewards immediately
- Maintain full voting rights throughout lock period

### Bond Boosters

The protocol rewards specific user activities through Bond Boosters, creating targeted incentives for valuable contributions:

**How Bond Boosters Work:**

- **Automatic Application**: Bond Boosters activate automatically during bond purchases
- **Unit-Based Limits**: Each user has a maximum number of "units" they can boost
- **Time Windows**: Bond Boosters expire at specific block numbers
- **Percentage Multipliers**: Bond Boosters add percentage bonuses to base bond amount

**Current Bond Booster Programs:**

- **Ripe Radness**: Rewards testnet participants
  - Bond Booster range: 10% to 200% based on contribution level
  - Top contributors receive maximum 200% Bond Booster
  - Most participants receive between 10-100% Bond Booster
  - Limited units per participant
  - Expires at predetermined block
  - Eligibility verified through Discord roles

**The Unit System:**
Units represent your Bond Booster capacity:

- 1 unit = 1 USDC
- Units consumed permanently (no refills)

Example scenarios with 1,000 units and 200% Bond Booster:

- **Scenario A**: Bond 500 USDC → uses 500 units, all 500 USDC gets boosted (500 units remain)
- **Scenario B**: Bond 1,500 USDC → uses all 1,000 units, only first 1,000 USDC gets boosted
- **Scenario C**: Bond 500 USDC first, then bond 1,000 USDC later → second bond only has 500 units left, so only 500 of the 1,000 USDC gets boosted

**Stacking Example:**
Top-tier testnet participant bonds 1,000 USDC with 3-year lock:

- Base: 2,000 RIPE (at $0.50/RIPE)
- Lock bonus: +4,000 RIPE (200% of base)
- Radness Bond Booster: +4,000 RIPE (200% of base for top contributors)
- **Total: 10,000 RIPE (5x multiplier)**

_Note: Most participants receive smaller Bond Boosters. With a 50% Radness Bond Booster, total would be 7,000 RIPE (3.5x multiplier)_

## Real-World Bonding Examples

### Example 1: Maximum Value Strategy

_Sarah bonds 5,000 USDC with full commitment_

- **Epoch Status**: 7 hours into 24-hour epoch (30% complete)
- **Base Rate**: $0.40 per RIPE → 12,500 RIPE base
- **3-Year Lock**: +200% → 25,000 RIPE bonus
- **Radness Bond Booster**: +200% → 25,000 RIPE bonus
- **Total Received**: 62,500 RIPE (locked 3 years)
- **Effective Price**: $0.08 per RIPE

### Example 2: Balanced Approach

_James bonds 10,000 USDC with moderate lock_

- **Epoch Status**: 17 hours into 24-hour epoch (70% complete)
- **Base Rate**: $0.25 per RIPE → 40,000 RIPE base
- **6-Month Lock**: +35% → 14,000 RIPE bonus
- **No Bond Booster**: 0 RIPE bonus
- **Total Received**: 54,000 RIPE (locked 6 months)
- **Effective Price**: $0.185 per RIPE

## Understanding Bad Debt Mechanics

When protocol liquidations create bad debt, bonds serve as a recovery mechanism:

**How Bond Purchases Work During Bad Debt:**

- Bond purchasers receive **100% of calculated RIPE allocation**
- Bond proceeds directly clear bad debt from the system
- Protocol health improves with each bond sale

**Supply Expansion Mechanism:**

- RIPE allocated to cover bad debt gets minted **beyond the 1 billion cap**
- Example: If 1M RIPE covers bad debt, total supply becomes 1.001 billion
- This expansion dilutes all RIPE holders proportionally
- Protocol transparently tracks all additional RIPE minted

**Design Rationale:**

- Bond purchasers always receive full allocation regardless of protocol state
- Bad debt costs are socialized across all token holders via dilution
- Bond demand remains strong even during protocol stress
- Governance has incentive to minimize bad debt to prevent dilution

This mechanism ensures bonds function as both a treasury building tool and an emergency recovery system.

## Bond Proceeds and Treasury Management

All stablecoins from bond sales flow directly to the [Endaoment](11-endaoment.md), becoming productive protocol assets:

**Treasury Deployment Strategy:**

- **Yield Farming**: Earns returns across DeFi via Underscore Protocol integrations
- **GREEN Liquidity**: Provides permanent trading depth for the stablecoin
- **Market Operations**: Defends GREEN's $1 peg during volatility
- **Strategic Reserves**: Backstops the protocol during extreme events

**The Flywheel Effect:**

```
Your Bonds → Treasury Growth → More Yield → Stronger Protocol
     ↑                                              ↓
     └────── Higher RIPE Value ← Better GREEN ←────┘
```

Unlike protocols that waste treasury on temporary incentives, every bond dollar becomes permanent productive capital working 24/7 for protocol sustainability.

## Time to Choose: Mercenary or Builder?

Here's the choice that matters:

Bond with a 3-year lock? Get up to 3x base allocation. Add Bond Boosters? Multiply again.

Wait for exchanges? Pay market price. No bonuses. No multipliers. Just hoping someone sells.

But this isn't really about the discount. It's about what happens to your money. Every dollar bonded becomes permanent protocol capital. Not exit liquidity for VCs. Not marketing budgets. Actual yield-generating assets backing actual stablecoins.

The protocol needs capital. You want tokens. Bonds make it happen.

The epochs are running. The treasury is building. What are you waiting for?
