# Ripe Archives: Before We Got It Right

Every overnight success takes years. Here's ours.

These archives trace Ripe's evolution from a wild idea — what if you could earn yield on anything? — through the realization that became our breakthrough: the real unlock wasn't yield on everything, it was borrowing against everything. One unified loan backed by your entire portfolio. We called it jUSD before it was GREEN. We pivoted from a neobank to pure DeFi. We discovered that capital efficiency beats yield farming every time.

Read this if you want to understand not just what Ripe is, but why it exists.

### The Vision

*Why we're building Ripe Protocol — a founder's perspective*

[The Vision](https://www.ripe.finance/vision) – Mick Hagen's deeply personal take on why Ripe exists and where it's headed. Not your typical corporate vision statement.

**Key themes:**
- **Real-world assets as the unlock**: $13B tokenized today, $16T projected by 2030
- **Financial inclusion over speculation**: A Guatemalan farmer borrowing against land matters more than another yield farm
- **Personal mission**: From watching his immigrant mother pursue opportunity to witnessing poverty in Brazil
- **Practical impact**: Turning idle assets (homes, land, businesses) into productive capital

The core insight: "Ripe Protocol is fundamentally about unlocking opportunity... giving people access to tools and services that previously belonged only to the elite."

This isn't about disrupting banks or maximizing APYs. It's about a farmer getting a loan, a family earning on their home equity, an entrepreneur expanding their business. Basic financial tools that change lives.

## The Story Continues

These documents capture where we've been. The whiteboard sessions. The strategic pivots. The moments we almost gave up and the breakthroughs that kept us going.

But the best protocols aren't museums — they're living systems. What you're reading is history. What you're using is the future.

Ripe keeps evolving because you keep building with it.

_From the archives to the frontier. See you there._
