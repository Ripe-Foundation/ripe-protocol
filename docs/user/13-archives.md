# Ripe Archives: The Journey from Vision to Reality

Explore the evolution of Ripe Protocol through our historical documentation. These archives chronicle how our core idea — unified multi-collateral lending where your entire portfolio backs a single loan — developed and refined over time. While these materials are now outdated, they offer invaluable insights into our design philosophy, years of iteration and refinement, and the community feedback that shaped today's protocol.

> **Note**: For current functionality, refer to our [main documentation](README.md). These archives are for historical reference only.
