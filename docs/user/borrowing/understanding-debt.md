# Understanding Debt

Debt in Ripe Protocol consists of principal and accrued interest, tracked through sophisticated mechanisms that ensure precision and capital efficiency.

## Debt Components

Your total debt consists of two parts that are tracked separately:

### 1. Principal
The original amount you borrowed:
- Fixed at borrowing time
- Doesn't change until repayment
- The baseline for interest calculations

### 2. Accrued Interest
The cost of borrowing over time:
- Accumulates continuously
- Compounds into the total
- Rate based on your collateral mix

**Total Debt = Principal + Accrued Interest**

## How Interest Accumulates

### Interest Accumulation Mechanics

The protocol implements continuous interest compounding:

- Block-level interest accrual provides smooth growth
- Continuous compounding creates effective rates slightly above nominal
- Predictable debt growth based on time and rate parameters

## Weighted Debt Terms

With multiple collateral types, your debt terms are weighted averages:

### How Weighting Works

Each asset contributes to your overall terms based on its borrowing power:

Each asset's contribution to borrowing power determines its weight in rate calculations. Assets with higher LTV ratios and values exert proportionally greater influence on the weighted average rate.

### Weighting Impact

The weighted average system ensures:
- Lower-risk assets reduce overall borrowing costs
- Portfolio diversification affects rate determination
- Asset composition directly influences debt terms

## Critical Debt Thresholds

Ripe Protocol uses three key thresholds that determine your position's safety. Understanding these is crucial for managing your debt effectively.

### Threshold Framework

Three critical ratios govern position safety:
- **LTV Ratio**: Determines maximum borrowing capacity
- **Redemption Threshold**: Activates deleveraging mechanisms
- **Liquidation Threshold**: Triggers forced collateral sales

### 1. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio

**What it is**: Your basic borrowing limit
**How it works**: You can borrow up to this percentage of your collateral value
**Direction**: Higher debt OR lower collateral value → Higher LTV (bad)
**Calculation**: `Maximum Debt = Collateral Value × LTV%`

The LTV ratio establishes the upper bound for borrowing against deposited collateral value.

### 2. Redemption Threshold

**What it is**: The danger zone where other users can redeem your collateral
**How it works**: When your collateral value drops below a certain ratio to your debt
**Calculation**: `Minimum Collateral = Debt × 100% / Redemption Threshold%`

**Example**:
```
Your debt: $8,000 GREEN
Redemption threshold: 90%
Redemption triggers when collateral < $8,889
(Because $8,000 × 100% / 90% = $8,889)
```

**Important**: When in the redemption zone, other GREEN holders can pay off portions of your debt and take equivalent collateral. This helps restore GREEN's peg while giving you a warning before liquidation.

### 3. Liquidation Threshold

**What it is**: The critical point where forced liquidation occurs
**How it works**: When your collateral value drops below the minimum required
**Calculation**: `Minimum Collateral = Debt × 100% / Liquidation Threshold%`

**Example**:
```
Your debt: $8,000 GREEN
Liquidation threshold: 95%
Liquidation triggers when collateral < $8,421
(Because $8,000 × 100% / 95% = $8,421)
```

**Critical**: At this point, your position will be liquidated through the three-phase liquidation system.

## How Thresholds Work Together

### Risk Progression Example

**Starting Position**:
- Collateral: $10,000
- Maximum borrow (80% LTV): $8,000
- You borrow: $7,000
- Initial safety margin: $3,000

**As collateral value drops OR debt grows from interest**:

1. **Healthy Zone** (Collateral > $8,750)
   - Below maximum LTV
   - No risk of redemption or liquidation
   - Can still borrow more

2. **Redemption Zone** (Collateral between $7,778 - $7,368)
   - Redemption threshold: 90%
   - Others can redeem your collateral
   - Warning to add collateral or repay debt

3. **Liquidation Zone** (Collateral < $7,368)
   - Liquidation threshold: 95%
   - Forced liquidation begins
   - Three-phase liquidation process activates

### Key Insight: The Inverse Relationship

Unlike LTV which is a forward calculation (debt as % of collateral), redemption and liquidation thresholds work inversely:
- They define the **minimum collateral required** for a given debt level
- As your collateral drops OR debt grows, you approach these danger zones
- Higher threshold percentages = tighter requirements

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Interest Impact on Thresholds

**Day 1**:
- Collateral: $10,000
- Debt: $6,000
- Safe from all thresholds

**Day 180** (5% APR):
- Collateral: $10,000 (unchanged)
- Debt: $6,150 (with interest)
- Redemption threshold: $6,833 (closer to danger)
- Still safe but margin reduced

### Example 2: Multi-Collateral Weighted Thresholds

When you have multiple assets, thresholds are weighted by debt capacity:

```
Asset A: $8,000 value, 80% LTV, 90% redemption threshold
Asset B: $2,000 value, 50% LTV, 80% redemption threshold

Weighted redemption threshold = 
  (90% × $6,400 + 80% × $1,000) / $7,400 = 88.6%
```

## Real-Time Position Monitoring

### Understanding Your Health Factor

Your health factor is simply how much cushion you have:
- **Healthy**: Your collateral is worth significantly more than your debt
- **At Risk**: Your collateral value is getting close to your debt amount
- **Danger**: Your collateral barely covers your debt

### Risk Indicator Thresholds

The protocol operates with clear risk boundaries:

| Metric | Safe Zone | Caution Zone | Danger Zone |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Collateralization Ratio** | >150% | 120-150% | <120% |
| **Distance to Redemption** | >20% | 10-20% | <10% |
| **Distance to Liquidation** | >15% | 5-15% | <5% |
| **Interest Coverage** | Positive | Neutral | Negative |

### Market Condition Monitoring

Key protocol metrics that affect debt positions:
- Collateral value fluctuations impact position health
- Health factor degradation accelerates near thresholds
- Interest rate changes affect long-term debt sustainability
- Pool health stress increases dynamic rate adjustments

## Practical Debt Management

### Safety Buffer Calculations

Buffer zones between thresholds provide reaction time:

```
Maximum LTV: 80%
Safe operating range: 60% (25% buffer)
Redemption threshold: 111% collateralization
Safe collateralization: 140% (26% buffer)
```

Larger buffers increase position resilience to market volatility.

### Interest Optimization

**Compound Effect Example**:
```
Borrow: $10,000 at 5% APR
Daily interest: $1.37
Monthly interest: $41.10
Yearly interest: $512.75 (with compounding)

Monthly repayment reduces compound interest impact
Savings: ~$12.75/year
```

### Position Management at Critical Thresholds

The protocol design creates natural intervention points:

**125% Collateralization Zone**: Buffer erosion indicates increasing risk. Stablecoin additions provide immediate ratio improvement due to high LTV parameters.

**115% Collateralization Zone**: Approaching protocol safety mechanisms. Debt reduction or collateral addition becomes economically critical.

**110% Collateralization Zone**: Redemption mechanism activation imminent. Market forces incentivize position adjustment through redemption pressure.

## Advanced Debt Metrics

### Effective Interest Rate

Your true cost includes:
- Base borrow rate
- Compounding frequency
- Origination fee (amortized)
- Opportunity cost

**Calculation**:
```
Effective APR = Base Rate + (Daowry / Loan Term) + Compound Effect
Example: 5% + (0.5% / 1 year) + 0.25% = 5.75% true cost
```

### Break-Even Analysis

When does borrowing make sense?

```
Asset appreciation needed = Effective borrow rate + Risk premium
Example: 5.75% cost + 2% risk = 7.75% required return

If ETH typically returns 15%+, borrowing at 7.75% is profitable
```
