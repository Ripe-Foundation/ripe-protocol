# Borrowing

Borrowing in Ripe Protocol means minting GREEN, a decentralized stablecoin backed by your deposited collateral. Unlike traditional lending where you receive existing tokens, GREEN is created specifically for your loan and destroyed when repaid, ensuring sustainable economics.

## Why Borrow?

Borrowing allows you to:
- **Access Liquidity**: Use your assets' value without selling
- **Maintain Exposure**: Keep upside potential while accessing funds
- **Tax Efficiency**: Loans aren't taxable events in most jurisdictions
- **Leverage Strategies**: Amplify positions or yield opportunities

- **GREEN Stablecoin**: Freshly minted, USD-pegged stability

## Key Concepts

### Borrowing Power
The maximum GREEN you can mint based on your collateral value and loan-to-value ratios.

### Debt Health
A measure of your position's safety. Good debt health means your collateral adequately covers your debt; bad debt health triggers liquidation eligibility.

### Interest Rates
Dynamic rates that adjust based on market conditions and asset types.

### Liquidation
The process of selling collateral to repay debt when positions become unsafe.

## Important Reminders

1. **Borrowing Creates Debt**: You must repay principal plus interest
2. **Collateral Can Be Liquidated**: Monitor your health factor
3. **Rates Can Change**: Interest rates adjust dynamically
4. **GREEN Must Maintain Peg**: Various mechanisms ensure stability
