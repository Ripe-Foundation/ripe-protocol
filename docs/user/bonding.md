# Ripe Bonds: Building Protocol Liquidity

Ripe Bonds offer users the opportunity to purchase RIPE tokens at a discount in exchange for providing stable assets that strengthen the protocol's treasury and GREEN liquidity.

## What Are Ripe Bonds?

Bonds are a mechanism where you can:
- **Buy RIPE tokens** at below market price
- **Pay with stablecoins** (USDC, USDT, etc.)
- **Get extra rewards** for locking your RIPE
- **Help bootstrap** GREEN's liquidity and stability

Think of it as an early-bird discount: you provide capital when the protocol needs it most, and receive RIPE at a discount in return.

## Why Bonds Matter

### For the Protocol

Bonds serve a critical purpose: **bootstrapping the Endaoment treasury**

**The flow:**
1. You purchase bonds with stablecoins
2. Your payment goes directly to the Endaoment
3. Endaoment uses these funds to:
   - Provide GREEN/stablecoin liquidity on Curve
   - Generate yield through DeFi strategies
   - Build reserves for market operations
   - Support GREEN peg stability

Without bonds, the protocol would need to:
- Rely solely on fees (slow growth)
- Print tokens without backing (inflationary)
- Depend on external funding (less decentralized)

### For You

**Discounted RIPE**: Buy below market price
**Lock bonuses**: Up to 10x more RIPE for longer locks
**Activity bonuses**: Extra rewards based on protocol usage
**Supporting growth**: Your capital directly strengthens the ecosystem

## How Bonds Work

### Epoch System

Bonds are sold in **epochs** (time periods):
- Each epoch has limited availability
- Once sold out, new epoch may start
- Prevents unlimited token distribution
- Creates fair access for all users

**Example epoch:**
```
Duration: 7 days
Available: $100,000 worth of bonds
Min price: 0.8 RIPE per dollar
Max price: 1.2 RIPE per dollar
Status: 65% sold
```

### Dynamic Pricing

Within each epoch, prices follow a curve:
- **Start of epoch**: Higher price (less discount)
- **End of epoch**: Lower price (more discount)
- **Linear decrease**: Predictable pricing

This rewards:
- Early buyers with guaranteed availability
- Patient buyers with better prices
- Everyone with transparent, fair pricing

### Lock-Up Bonuses

Get more RIPE by locking your tokens. The bonus multiplier is configurable by governance:

**Example bonus structure:**
```
No lock: 1,000 RIPE (1x)
30-day lock: 1,100 RIPE (1.1x)
90-day lock: 1,250 RIPE (1.25x)
180-day lock: 1,500 RIPE (1.5x)
1-year lock: 1,750 RIPE (1.75x)
3-year lock: 2,000 RIPE (2x max)
```

Locked RIPE goes to governance vault:
- Can't be sold (reduces sell pressure)
- Still counts for voting power
- Unlocks after your chosen duration

**Note:** The exact bonus multipliers and maximum lock duration are set by governance and may change based on protocol needs.

### Ripe Radness Bond Booster

Early testnet contributors receive the **Ripe Radness** boost as a thank you for helping test the protocol:

**How it works:**
- Testnet testers get bonus RIPE when purchasing bonds
- Boost ratio is configurable (e.g., 2x means double RIPE)
- Limited to a maximum number of units (e.g., 1000 USDC worth)
- Expires at a specific block number
- Stacks with lock bonuses for maximum rewards

**Example boost:**
- Base bond purchase: 1,000 RIPE
- Ripe Radness boost (2x): +1,000 RIPE  
- Total with boost: 2,000 RIPE

**Important notes:**
- Once you've used your maximum units, the boost is exhausted
- Boost expires after the configured block number
- Cannot be transferred or renewed
- Automatically applied when you purchase bonds

## Bond Purchase Example

```
Current epoch status:
- Payment asset: USDC
- Progress: 40% sold
- Current price: 1.0 RIPE per USDC
- Your purchase: 1,000 USDC
- Lock duration: 1 year

Calculation:
- Base payout: 1,000 RIPE
- Lock bonus (1.75x): +750 RIPE
- Ripe Radness boost (2x): +1,000 RIPE (if eligible)
- Total received: 2,750 RIPE

Result:
- You pay: 1,000 USDC
- You receive: 2,750 RIPE (locked 1 year)
- Effective price: $0.36 per RIPE
- Discount: 64% below $1 market price
```

## Bad Debt Consideration

If the protocol has bad debt from liquidations:
- Your full payment still goes to the treasury
- Part of your RIPE payout is allocated to clear bad debt
- You receive fewer RIPE tokens proportionally
- Helps maintain protocol solvency
- Temporary until debt is cleared

**Example with bad debt:**
```
Your payment: 1,000 USDC (full amount to treasury)
Total RIPE earned: 2,750 RIPE
Bad debt to clear: $100 (10% of your payment value)
RIPE for bad debt: 275 RIPE (10% of your payout)
RIPE you receive: 2,475 RIPE (90% of normal amount)
```

## How Your Purchase Helps

When you buy $10,000 in bonds:

1. **Immediate Impact**
   - $10,000 goes to Endaoment treasury
   - Deploys to yield strategies (~5% APY)
   - Generates $500/year for protocol

2. **Liquidity Creation**
   - Enables $20,000 GREEN/USDC pool
   - Provides trading liquidity
   - Stabilizes GREEN price

3. **Ecosystem Growth**
   - Stronger treasury = better stability
   - More liquidity = more users
   - Growing protocol = RIPE appreciation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Win-Win Mechanism** - You get discounted RIPE, protocol gets liquidity
2. **Flexible Options** - Choose your lock duration and bonus level
3. **Direct Impact** - Your funds immediately strengthen GREEN liquidity
4. **Fair System** - Transparent pricing and equal access
5. **Long-term Value** - Supports sustainable protocol growth

Bonds are the foundation of Ripe's liquidity strategy, turning community capital into protocol strength while rewarding participants with discounted tokens.

Your bond purchase directly contributes to GREEN's stability and Ripe's long-term success.
