# RIPE Block Rewards: Earning While You Participate

RIPE block rewards are the heartbeat of Ripe Protocol's incentive system — continuously distributing tokens to users who actively strengthen the ecosystem. Whether you're borrowing GREEN, providing liquidity, or simply holding assets, the protocol rewards your participation with a share of 150 million RIPE tokens allocated specifically for community incentives.

## The Reward Engine

### Continuous Token Flow

Unlike traditional yield farming with discrete epochs, Ripe's rewards flow continuously:

- **Every Block Counts**: New RIPE tokens mint with each blockchain block
- **Real-Time Accumulation**: Your rewards grow second by second, not weekly or monthly
- **No Waiting Periods**: Start earning immediately upon participation
- **Fair Distribution**: Time-weighted system prevents gaming or manipulation

### The Points System

Ripe uses an elegant points mechanism that rewards both size and commitment:

```
Points = Position Size × Time Held (in blocks)
```

This simple formula creates profound fairness — a smaller position held longer can earn more than a whale's brief deposit. It's democracy through mathematics.

## Four Ways to Earn

The protocol splits rewards across four participant categories, each serving a vital ecosystem function:

### 1. Borrowers (Debt Creates Demand)

Taking out GREEN loans earns rewards proportional to your debt:

- **Reward Basis**: Outstanding GREEN principal × time borrowed
- **Why It Matters**: Borrowing creates GREEN demand and protocol revenue
- **Smart Strategy**: Larger, longer-term loans maximize rewards
- **Real Benefit**: Offset borrowing costs with RIPE earnings

### 2. Stakers (Security Through Commitment)  

Staking in protocol vaults earns enhanced rewards:

**Governance Vault (RIPE & RIPE LP)**
- **Base Rewards**: Size × time × asset weight
- **Lock Multiplier**: Up to 3x boost for maximum duration locks
- **LP Advantage**: RIPE LP tokens earn 50% more points than RIPE
- **Compound Strategy**: Auto-stake rewards for exponential growth

**Stability Pools (sGREEN & GREEN LP)**
- **Dual Yield**: RIPE rewards plus liquidation profits
- **No Lock Required**: Flexible liquidity with full rewards
- **Risk Buffer**: Help secure the protocol while earning

### 3. Vote Depositors (Community Choice)

When governance activates, token holders will vote on which assets earn bonus rewards:

- **Democratic Selection**: Community chooses reward-earning assets
- **Targeted Incentives**: Direct liquidity where protocol needs it most
- **Strategic Deposits**: Align your holdings with governance decisions
- **Future Activation**: Building anticipation for full decentralization

### 4. General Depositors (Universal Participation)

Every vault deposit earns baseline rewards:

- **USD-Weighted**: Fair distribution based on deposit value
- **Asset Agnostic**: All supported assets participate equally
- **Passive Income**: Earn just by holding assets in Ripe vaults
- **Portfolio Friendly**: Diversification doesn't reduce rewards

## Understanding Your Share

### Asset-Specific Allocations

Each supported asset has its own configuration that determines how it splits the top-level reward pools:

- **Staker Points Allocation**: Percentage of the total Stakers pool this asset receives
  - Only applies to staked assets (RIPE, RIPE LP in Governance Vault; sGREEN, GREEN LP in Stability Pools)
  - Example: If RIPE has 40% allocation and RIPE LP has 60%, they split the Stakers pool accordingly
  
- **Voter Points Allocation**: Percentage of the Vote Depositors pool this asset receives
  - Only for assets selected through governance voting
  - All voter allocations across eligible assets must sum to 100%
  - Staked assets have 0% voter allocation since they earn from the Stakers pool

**Important**: These percentages split their respective category pools. If Vote Depositors receive 20% of total emissions and Asset A has 50% voter allocation, Asset A depositors share 10% of total emissions (50% of 20%).

### Two-Layer Calculation

Your rewards flow through a precise distribution system:

**Layer 1: Your Share of Asset Pool**
```
Your Share = Your Points / Total Asset Points
```

**Layer 2: Asset's Share of Category**
```
Asset Share = (Asset Points × Asset Allocation) / Total Category Points
```

**Combined Result**
```
Your Rewards = Your Share × Asset Share × Category Pool
```

### Real Example

Let's walk through Alice's RIPE staking rewards:

**Given:**
- Total emissions: 100 RIPE/block
- Staker allocation: 30% (30 RIPE)
- RIPE token allocation: 60% of staker pool
- Alice stakes: 1,000 RIPE for 100 blocks
- Total RIPE staked: 10,000 for same period

**Calculation:**
1. Alice's share of RIPE pool: 1,000/10,000 = 10%
2. RIPE's daily staker rewards: 60% × 30 = 18 RIPE
3. Alice's base earnings: 10% × 18 = 1.8 RIPE
4. Plus any lock duration bonus multiplier

## Smart Claiming Strategies

### Two Paths to Value

When claiming accumulated rewards, choose your strategy:

**1. Liquid RIPE** (Immediate Value)
- Receive tokens directly to wallet
- Full liquidity for trading or use
- No commitment required
- Instant gratification

**2. Auto-Stake** (Compound Growth)
- Automatically deposit into governance vault
- Earn governance points immediately
- Compound future rewards
- Build long-term influence

### Auto-Stake Parameters

The protocol enforces auto-staking to balance token distribution with long-term alignment:

- **Stake Ratio**: Protocol-determined percentage that must be staked
  - Example: At 70% ratio, only 30% goes to your wallet as liquid RIPE
  - Prevents market flooding while building committed participants
  
- **Duration Ratio**: Governance sets the required lock duration
  - Example: 50% ratio × 3-year max = mandatory 1.5-year lock
  - Ensures reward recipients become long-term stakeholders
  
**Why This Matters**: Rather than dumping tokens on the market, auto-staking creates a community of invested participants who earn governance power alongside their rewards. You're not just earning tokens — you're earning a voice in the protocol's future.

## Maximizing Your Rewards

### Strategic Positioning

**For Borrowers:**
- Maintain healthy debt levels for consistent earnings
- Longer loan terms = more accumulated rewards
- Use rewards to offset interest costs

**For Stakers:**
- Lock RIPE longer for multiplied earnings
- Provide LP tokens for 50% bonus weight
- Auto-stake rewards to compound returns

**For Depositors:**
- Diversify across vaults while maintaining positions
- Hold for extended periods to maximize points
- Watch for governance votes on reward allocations

### The Compound Effect

Consider the power of auto-staking:
- Initial deposit: 1,000 RIPE
- Monthly rewards: 50 RIPE
- Auto-stake ratio: 100%
- After 1 year: Earning rewards on 1,600 RIPE
- Exponential growth through compounding

## Protocol Configuration

### Flexible Parameters

MissionControl governs all reward settings:

- **Emission Rate**: RIPE tokens minted per block
- **Category Splits**: Percentage to each participant type
- **Asset Allocations**: Individual asset point multipliers
- **Auto-Stake Settings**: Default ratios and durations

### Governance Evolution

Once activated, RIPE holders will control:
- Emission schedules and rates
- Category allocation adjustments
- Asset-specific incentives
- New reward mechanisms

## Why This Matters

### Sustainable Incentives

RIPE rewards create a virtuous cycle:
1. Users participate for rewards
2. Participation strengthens protocol
3. Stronger protocol attracts more users
4. More users increase reward competition
5. Competition drives deeper participation

### Fair Distribution

The time-weighted system ensures:
- **No Whale Dominance**: Time matters as much as size
- **Accessible Entry**: Small holders can earn meaningfully
- **Loyalty Rewards**: Long-term participants benefit most
- **Transparent Calculation**: Anyone can verify their share

### Economic Alignment

Every reward serves protocol health:
- **Borrowers**: Create GREEN demand and fees
- **Stakers**: Provide security and governance
- **Depositors**: Supply liquidity and collateral
- **All Participants**: Build network effects

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Path**: Decide between borrowing, staking, or depositing
2. **Commit Capital**: Deploy assets into protocol positions
3. **Monitor Points**: Watch your rewards accumulate in real-time
4. **Claim Strategically**: Optimize between liquidity and compounding
5. **Stay Engaged**: Participate in governance when it launches
