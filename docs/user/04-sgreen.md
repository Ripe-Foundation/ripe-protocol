# sGREEN: Set It and Forget It Yield

Your stablecoins are lazy. Sitting there. Doing nothing. Earning nothing.

Meanwhile, Ripe borrowers are paying interest on loans backed by everything from ETH to jpegs. That interest? It could be yours. Just deposit [GREEN](01-green-stablecoin.md) into sGREEN and start capturing every penny of protocol revenue. No staking. No claiming. No thinking.

The best part? You get paid even if borrowers ghost the protocol. Welcome to yield that actually works.

## Understanding sGREEN

sGREEN is GREEN's yield-bearing twin — a set-and-forget savings vault that automatically compounds protocol revenues into your holdings. Built on the battle-tested ERC-4626 standard, it transforms idle stablecoins into productive capital without the hassle of claiming rewards or managing positions.

## Where Your Yield Comes From

Every sGREEN holder benefits from multiple real protocol revenue streams:

1. **Borrower Interest Payments**: Continuous yield from all active loans across the protocol
2. **Origination Fees (Daowry)**: 0.5% fee on every new loan minted instantly adds value
3. **Unrealized Yield Flush**: Even if borrowers never repay, their accrued interest is periodically "flushed" to sGREEN holders through new GREEN minting. You don't wait for loan repayments to get your yield — the protocol ensures sGREEN value grows continuously regardless of borrower behavior
4. **Future Treasury Yields**: [Governance](08-governance.md) can direct [Endaoment](11-endaoment.md) profits to sGREEN holders

This isn't speculative yield — it's real revenue from actual protocol usage that compounds automatically into your position.

## How to Use sGREEN

### Option 1: Direct Deposit (Simplest)

Convert your GREEN to sGREEN with one transaction:

- Deposit any amount of GREEN to the vault
- Receive sGREEN shares at the current exchange rate
- Start earning immediately with no minimum or lock-up

**Example**: At a 1.1 rate, depositing 1,100 GREEN gives you 1,000 sGREEN

### Option 2: Borrow Directly in sGREEN

Advanced strategy for sophisticated users:

- Take out loans denominated in sGREEN instead of GREEN
- Your debt stays constant while your sGREEN grows
- Profit when sGREEN yield exceeds your borrow rate

**The Math**: Borrow at 5% APR, earn 8% on sGREEN = 3% net profit on borrowed funds

### Option 3: Deploy to [Stability Pools](05-stability-pools.md) (Maximum Yield)

Stack multiple revenue streams by depositing sGREEN in stability pools:

- **Keep earning**: sGREEN base yield continues
- **Add liquidations**: Buy collateral at 5-15% discounts
- **Plus rewards**: Earn [RIPE tokens](09-ripe-rewards.md) on top
- **Triple stack**: All three sources compound together

**Potential Returns**: Base yield + liquidation profits + RIPE rewards = significant APR

## Getting Paid No Matter What

Here's what most people miss: sGREEN holders get their yield even if borrowers ghost the protocol.

**How It Works**:

- Borrowers accumulate interest every block (paid or unpaid)
- This interest is tracked but not yet "realized" as new GREEN
- Periodically, the protocol "flushes" this unrealized yield
- New GREEN is minted to represent the accrued interest
- sGREEN exchange rate increases, capturing this value

**What This Means**:

- Your yield doesn't depend on borrowers being good actors
- Interest compounds into sGREEN value whether loans are repaid or not
- When borrowers eventually repay (or get liquidated), that GREEN is burned
- The system stays balanced while you keep earning

## The sGREEN Advantage

### How Value Accumulates Automatically

Unlike traditional staking where you claim rewards, sGREEN uses an elegant share-based system:

- **Set and Forget**: Your sGREEN balance stays constant while its GREEN value increases
- **No Gas Fees**: Value accrues through exchange rate appreciation, not token distributions
- **Compound Growth**: All revenues automatically reinvest, accelerating returns
- **Monotonic Rate**: The exchange rate can only increase — mathematically impossible to decrease

**Real Example**: Deposit 1,000 GREEN at 1.0 rate → Wait one year → Rate becomes 1.08 → Your sGREEN now worth 1,080 GREEN. Zero actions required.

### True DeFi Flexibility

- **Instant Redemption**: Convert to GREEN anytime, no delays or penalties
- **Zero Lock-ups**: Your capital is never trapped or restricted
- **Full Transferability**: Send, trade, or use sGREEN like any ERC-20
- **Tax Efficiency**: Value accrues through price appreciation, not taxable distributions

## Real User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Passive Saver

_Sarah deposits 10,000 GREEN into sGREEN and forgets about it for a year_

- Starting rate: 1.00 (10,000 sGREEN received)
- After 1 year at 7% APR: Rate is 1.07
- Sarah's value: 10,700 GREEN
- **Profit: 700 GREEN with zero actions taken**

### Scenario 2: The Yield Farmer

_Alex deposits 50,000 GREEN worth of sGREEN into stability pools_

- sGREEN base yield: 6% = 3,000 GREEN/year
- Liquidation profits: 8% = 4,000 GREEN/year
- RIPE rewards: 4% = 2,000 GREEN equivalent/year
- **Total return: 9,000 GREEN (18% APR) plus compounding**

### Scenario 3: The Arbitrageur

_Jordan borrows 100,000 GREEN as sGREEN at 5% APR_

- Borrowing cost: 5,000 GREEN/year
- sGREEN earnings at 8%: 8,000 GREEN/year
- **Net profit: 3,000 GREEN/year on borrowed capital**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does sGREEN compare to other yield-bearing stablecoins?**
A: The difference isn't just sGREEN — it's the entire Ripe ecosystem:

- **Diverse Revenue**: sGREEN captures yield from a protocol that accepts EVERYTHING as collateral (NFTs, memecoins, yield positions), not just ETH/USDC
- **Unrealized Yield Flush**: You get paid even if borrowers never repay — unique to Ripe
- **Triple Stack Potential**: Deploy sGREEN to stability pools for base yield + liquidations + RIPE rewards
- **Real Demand**: Borrowers use Ripe because they can leverage their entire portfolio in one position — creating sustainable yield sources
- Other yield-bearing stables rely on narrow use cases or subsidized APYs. sGREEN's yield comes from solving a real problem: unified portfolio borrowing.

**Q: What drives sGREEN yields?**
A: Real borrowing demand. More loans = more interest and fees = higher sGREEN yields. It's sustainable because borrowers get productive capital.

**Q: Is there a minimum deposit?**
A: No minimums. Whether you have 10 GREEN or 10 million, you earn the same percentage yield.

**Q: Can sGREEN be used as collateral?**
A: Not currently within Ripe Protocol, but other DeFi protocols may accept it. Its appreciating nature makes it attractive collateral, potentially offering better terms than regular stablecoins.

**Q: What happens during market crashes?**
A: sGREEN remains stable. Market volatility often increases borrowing and liquidations, potentially boosting yields during turbulent times.

**Q: How often does the exchange rate update?**
A: Every transaction updates the rate in real-time. No waiting for daily rebase or epoch updates.

## Stop Leaving Money on the Table

Every block, Ripe borrowers generate interest. Every new loan pays fees. Every liquidation creates value.

Without sGREEN, you're watching that revenue flow past you. With sGREEN, you're catching it all — automatically compounding into your position while you sleep, work, or forget crypto exists.

One deposit. Infinite compounding. Zero effort.

Your stablecoins have been lazy long enough.
