# Savings GREEN (sGREEN): Your GREEN Working Harder

sGREEN transforms idle GREEN stablecoins into productive capital that automatically captures all protocol revenues. It's the simplest way to earn real yield in DeFi — no staking, no claiming, no complexity. Just deposit GREEN and watch your wealth grow through the power of compound interest.

## The sGREEN Advantage

### Automatic Wealth Accumulation

Unlike traditional staking where you must claim rewards, sGREEN operates on an elegant share-based system that compounds value automatically:

- **Set and Forget**: Your sGREEN balance stays constant while its GREEN value increases daily
- **No Gas Fees**: Value accrues through exchange rate appreciation, not token distributions
- **Compound Growth**: All revenues automatically reinvest, accelerating your returns
- **Capital Preservation**: The exchange rate can only increase — never decrease

**Real Example**: If you deposited 1,000 GREEN when the rate was 1.0 and it's now 1.08, your sGREEN is worth 1,080 GREEN — an 8% gain with zero effort.

### Where Your Yield Comes From

Every sGREEN holder benefits from multiple protocol revenue streams that flow directly to the vault:

1. **Borrower Interest Payments**: Continuous yield from all active loans across the protocol
2. **Origination Fees (Daowry)**: 0.5% fee on every new loan minted instantly adds value
3. **Unrealized Yield Flush**: Accrued interest from borrowers gets distributed to sGREEN holders
4. **Future Treasury Yields**: Governance can direct Endaoment profits to sGREEN holders

This isn't speculative yield — it's real revenue from actual protocol usage.

## Two Ways to Access sGREEN

### 1. Direct Deposit (Most Common)
Convert your GREEN to sGREEN with a simple deposit:
- Deposit any amount of GREEN to the vault
- Receive sGREEN shares at the current exchange rate
- Start earning immediately with no minimum or lock-up

**Example**: At a 1.1 rate, depositing 1,100 GREEN gives you 1,000 sGREEN

### 2. Smart Borrowing Strategy
Sophisticated users can borrow directly in sGREEN:
- Take out loans denominated in sGREEN instead of GREEN
- Your debt stays constant while your sGREEN grows
- Profit when sGREEN yield exceeds your borrow rate

**The Math**: Borrow at 5% APR, earn 8% on sGREEN = 3% net profit on borrowed funds

## Advanced Strategy: Stability Pool

Deposit sGREEN in stability pools to stack multiple revenue streams:

1. **Base Layer**: Continue earning sGREEN's native yield
2. **Liquidation Layer**: Purchase discounted collateral (typically 5-15% below market)
3. **Rewards Layer**: Earn RIPE tokens from the protocol's staker allocation
4. **Compounding Effect**: All three layers work together, multiplying returns

**Example Scenario**: 
- sGREEN base yield: 6% APR
- Liquidation profits: 8% APR
- RIPE rewards: 4% APR
- **Total potential**: 18% APR (before compounding)

## Why sGREEN is Built Different

### Unbreakable Value Preservation
- **Monotonic Growth**: Exchange rate mathematically cannot decrease — only up or stable
- **Full Backing**: Every sGREEN always redeemable for its GREEN value
- **No Impairment Risk**: Protocol design prevents any value loss scenarios
- **Audited Security**: ERC-4626 standard implementation with comprehensive testing

### True DeFi Liquidity
- **Instant Redemption**: Convert to GREEN anytime with no delays
- **Zero Lock-ups**: Your capital is never trapped or restricted
- **No Exit Penalties**: Withdraw 100% of your value whenever needed
- **Full Transferability**: Send, trade, or use sGREEN anywhere ERC-20s are accepted

### Elegant Tax Efficiency
Unlike reward tokens that create taxable events, sGREEN's value accrues through price appreciation:
- No constant reward claiming
- Simplified accounting
- Potential tax advantages (consult your tax advisor)
- Clean transaction history

## Real User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Passive Saver
*Sarah deposits 10,000 GREEN into sGREEN and forgets about it for a year*
- Starting rate: 1.00 (10,000 sGREEN received)
- After 1 year at 7% APR: Rate is 1.07
- Sarah's value: 10,700 GREEN
- **Profit: 700 GREEN with zero actions taken**

### Scenario 2: The Yield Farmer
*Alex deposits 50,000 GREEN worth of sGREEN into stability pools*
- sGREEN base yield: 6% = 3,000 GREEN/year
- Liquidation profits: 8% = 4,000 GREEN/year
- RIPE rewards: 4% = 2,000 GREEN equivalent/year
- **Total return: 9,000 GREEN (18% APR) plus compounding**

### Scenario 3: The Arbitrageur
*Jordan borrows 100,000 GREEN as sGREEN at 5% APR*
- Borrowing cost: 5,000 GREEN/year
- sGREEN earnings at 8%: 8,000 GREEN/year
- **Net profit: 3,000 GREEN/year on borrowed capital**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does sGREEN compare to other yield-bearing stablecoins?**
A: sGREEN offers true decentralization, no lock-ups, and revenue from real protocol usage — not subsidized yields or risky strategies.

**Q: What drives sGREEN yields?**
A: Real borrowing demand. More loans = more interest and fees = higher sGREEN yields. It's sustainable because borrowers get productive capital.

**Q: Is there a minimum deposit?**
A: No minimums. Whether you have 10 GREEN or 10 million, you earn the same percentage yield.

**Q: Can sGREEN be used as collateral?**
A: Not currently within Ripe Protocol, but other DeFi protocols may accept it. Its appreciating nature makes it attractive collateral, potentially offering better terms than regular stablecoins.

**Q: What happens during market crashes?**
A: sGREEN remains stable. Market volatility often increases borrowing and liquidations, potentially boosting yields during turbulent times.

**Q: How often does the exchange rate update?**
A: Every transaction updates the rate in real-time. No waiting for daily rebase or epoch updates.

## The Bottom Line

sGREEN represents the evolution of stablecoin savings — combining the stability of GREEN with automatic yield generation that requires zero effort. Whether you're a passive holder seeking simple returns or an active strategist stacking yields, sGREEN provides the foundation for sustainable wealth accumulation in DeFi.

Your GREEN doesn't need to sit idle. Put it to work with sGREEN and let protocol revenues compound your wealth, automatically and perpetually.
