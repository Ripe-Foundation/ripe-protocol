# The Endaoment

The Endaoment is Ripe Protocol's treasury and liquidity management system that controls protocol assets, maintains [GREEN](01-green.md) stability through automated market operations, and generates yield across decentralized finance strategies. The Endaoment grows primarily through [bond sales](09-bonding.md), where users exchange stablecoins for RIPE tokens, with all proceeds flowing directly to the treasury.

## Core Functions

### 1. Asset Management

**Treasury Inflows:**
- **Bond proceeds** (primary source): Stablecoins from [Ripe Bonds](09-bonding.md) sales
- Stablecoins received from liquidation events
- GREEN LP tokens consumed during stability pool liquidations
- Protocol revenue from fees
- Partner capital contributions

**Capital Deployment:**
- Yield generation through Underscore Protocol's modular Lego adapters
- Asset allocation optimization across strategies
- Liquidity reserve maintenance
- Emergency response capabilities

### 2. GREEN Price Stabilization

The Green Stabilizer system monitors and adjusts Curve pool ratios to maintain GREEN's dollar peg:

**How It Works:**
The system targets a 50/50 balance between GREEN and other stablecoins in liquidity pools. When imbalances occur, it automatically intervenes.

**When GREEN is Under-Valued (>50% of pool):**
- Indicates GREEN trading below $1 (too much GREEN relative to other stables)
- System removes excess GREEN liquidity from the pool
- First repays any outstanding pool debt
- Burns remaining GREEN to reduce supply
- Result: GREEN scarcity drives price back to $1

**When GREEN is Over-Valued (<50% of pool):**
- Indicates GREEN trading above $1 (too little GREEN relative to other stables)
- System adds GREEN liquidity to increase supply
- May mint new GREEN (tracked as debt to prevent inflation)
- Result: Increased GREEN supply brings price back to $1

**Safety Mechanisms:**
- Debt ceiling limits prevent excessive GREEN creation
- Profitability constraints ensure operations benefit the protocol
- Weighted adjustments prevent over-correction

### 3. Yield Generation via Lego Architecture

The Endaoment interfaces with Underscore Protocol's Lego system - modular adapters that enable standardized interaction with various DeFi protocols:

**Protocol Integrations:**
- **Lending Markets**: Aave V3, Compound V3, Morpho, Euler, Fluid
- **Decentralized Exchanges**: Uniswap V2/V3, Curve, Aerodrome

**Capital Allocation Mechanics:**
The system distributes capital across multiple yield sources based on:
- Current market rates across protocols
- Risk parameters for each strategy
- Liquidity requirements and withdrawal needs
- Historical performance metrics

**Architectural Benefits:**
- Automatic integration of new protocols via standardized interface
- Risk isolation between different strategies
- Dynamic rebalancing across yield sources
- Upgradeable strategies without core contract changes

### 4. Partner Liquidity Programs

The protocol facilitates liquidity partnerships through two mechanisms:

**Mint and Pair Model:**
- Partner contributes external assets (e.g., USDC)
- Protocol mints equivalent value in GREEN
- Combined assets form liquidity pool
- LP tokens distributed according to contribution ratios

**Direct Liquidity Model:**
- Both parties provide existing tokens
- Flexible contribution ratios supported
- Participation in established pools

These partnerships create deeper liquidity pools, establish strategic relationships, and enable revenue sharing arrangements.

## Key Operational Details

### GREEN Minting Constraints
The Endaoment can only create GREEN tokens under specific conditions:
- **Stabilization operations**: With corresponding debt tracking to prevent inflation
- **Partnership liquidity programs**: With matching asset backing

### Yield Distribution
Generated yields from treasury operations flow to:
- Protocol operational expenses
- [sGREEN](05-sgreen.md) holder returns
- Reserve accumulation for future stability

### Risk Management
- Individual Lego strategy failures remain isolated
- Multiple yield sources provide diversification
- Governance sets risk parameters and strategy limits

## Why the Endaoment Matters

### Benefits to GREEN Holders
- **Peg Stability**: Automated market operations maintain GREEN's $1 value
- **Deeper Liquidity**: Treasury-owned liquidity reduces slippage for traders
- **Sustainable Backing**: Yield generation creates non-dilutive revenue streams

### Benefits to the Protocol
- **Self-Sufficiency**: Treasury yields fund operations without token inflation
- **Market Resilience**: Capital reserves provide stability during volatility
- **Growth Capital**: Partnership programs expand ecosystem reach

### Transparency
- All treasury holdings are visible on-chain
- Yield strategies and performance tracked in real-time
- Debt obligations clearly recorded for stabilization operations
