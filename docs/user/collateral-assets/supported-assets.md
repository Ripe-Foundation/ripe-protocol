# Asset Categories

Ripe Protocol's universal collateral system is designed to support a diverse range of assets, from battle-tested crypto assets to innovative new token types. This flexibility ensures you can use your entire portfolio productively, regardless of what you hold.

## Asset Categories Overview

### 1. Stablecoins

The foundation of many DeFi portfolios, stablecoins offer predictable value and high loan-to-value ratios.

**Examples:**
- **USDC**: Circle's regulated dollar stablecoin
- **USDT**: Tether's widely-used stablecoin
- **USDS**: Sky's decentralized stablecoin (formerly MakerDAO)
- **Yield-bearing stables**: Interest-earning stable assets

**Best For:** Users seeking maximum borrowing power with minimal liquidation risk due to stablecoins' predictable value.

### 2. Blue-Chip Crypto Assets

Established crypto assets with deep liquidity and proven track records.

**Examples:**
- **WETH**: Wrapped Ethereum
- **cbBTC**: Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin
- **Major DeFi Tokens**: Leading protocol governance tokens
- **Layer 1 tokens**: Native blockchain assets
- **Established altcoins**: Top market cap crypto assets

**Best For:** Long-term holders who want to access liquidity without selling their core positions.

### 3. Yield-Bearing Assets

Tokens that generate returns while serving as collateral, offering the best of both worlds.

**Examples:**
- **Liquid Staking Tokens**:
  - stETH (Lido Staked ETH)
  - rETH (Rocket Pool ETH)
  - Various LST providers
- **LP Tokens**: From DEX liquidity provision
- **Vault Tokens**: From yield aggregators
- **Interest-bearing tokens**: Lending protocol deposits (Aave, Morpho, Euler, etc)
- **Staked governance tokens**: Locked protocol tokens

**Key Benefit:** Your collateral continues earning its native yield while borrowed against. This means:
- Liquid staking tokens keep accruing staking rewards
- LP tokens continue earning trading fees
- Vault tokens keep auto-compounding
- No need to choose between yield and liquidity

**Example Strategy:** 
If stETH earns 4% and you borrow at 3%, you have a positive carry of 1%. This enables leveraged strategies where your collateral earns more than your borrowing costs.

**Best For:** Users who want their collateral to remain productive while borrowing.

### 4. Emerging Assets

The long tail of crypto innovation, including community tokens and experimental assets.

**Examples:**
- **Meme Coins**: Community-driven tokens like SHIB, PEPE
- **Gaming Tokens**: In-game currencies and reward tokens
- **Community Tokens**: DAO and social tokens
- **New Protocol Tokens**: Recently launched DeFi projects
- **Experimental Assets**: Novel token mechanisms

**Best For:** Diversifying collateral without selling speculative positions. These assets typically have more conservative parameters due to their volatility.

### 5. Tokenized Real-World Assets

The bridge between traditional finance and DeFi, bringing real-world value on-chain.

**Examples:**
- **Tokenized Securities**: Digital representations of stocks, bonds
- **Commodity Tokens**: Gold, silver, oil backed tokens
- **Real Estate Tokens**: Property-backed digital assets
- **Treasury Tokens**: Government bond representations
- **Invoice/Trade Finance**: Tokenized business receivables

**Compliance Features:**
- KYC verification requirements
- Accredited investor status checks
- Geographic restrictions
- Transfer limitations

**Special Handling:**
- Cannot be freely auctioned during liquidations
- Specific liquidator whitelists
- Direct redemption mechanisms only
- Compliance preserved throughout lifecycle

**Benefits:**
- Access DeFi liquidity while maintaining compliance
- Institutional-grade infrastructure
- Clear regulatory framework
- Segregated from permissionless assets

These assets have parameters that vary significantly based on the underlying asset type and regulatory framework.

### 6. NFTs & Tokenized Unique Assets

Non-fungible tokens represent unique digital assets, collectibles, and tokenized real-world items.

**Examples:**
- **PFP Collections**: Popular avatar projects (CryptoPunks, BAYC, Pudgy Penguins, etc)
- **Art NFTs**: Digital art and generative pieces (Ringers, Fidenzas, etc)
- **Utility NFTs**: Membership and access tokens
- **Gaming NFTs**: In-game assets, land, and items
- **Tokenized Luxury Items**: High-end watches, rare wines, classic cars
- **Tokenized Collectibles**: Sports memorabilia, trading cards, historical artifacts
- **Tokenized Real Estate**: Individual properties, fractional ownership tokens

**Key Characteristics:**
- Specialized valuation models
- Collection-based or individual appraisal parameters
- Different liquidation mechanisms
- Floor price or third-party valuation considerations

## How Assets Are Added

New assets don't appear randomly in Ripe. Each goes through a careful process:

1. **Community Proposal**: Users suggest new assets
2. **Risk Assessment**: Analysis of volatility, liquidity, and market metrics
3. **Parameter Setting**: Determining appropriate LTV, rates, and limits
4. **Governance Vote**: RIPE holders approve additions
5. **Technical Integration**: Smart contract updates and testing
6. **Gradual Rollout**: Conservative initial parameters, adjusted over time

## The Expanding Universe of Collateral

Ripe's architecture is designed to accommodate any tokenized value. The protocol can adapt to support new asset types as they emerge:

- **Prediction Market Shares**: Tokenized outcomes and betting positions
- **Carbon Credits**: Environmental assets and sustainability tokens
- **Intellectual Property**: Tokenized royalties and content rights
- **Synthetic Assets**: Derivatives and synthetic representations
- **Cross-chain Assets**: Tokens bridged from other blockchains
- **Privacy Tokens**: Assets with enhanced privacy features
- **And More**: If it's tokenized and has value, it can potentially serve as collateral

The key is maintaining a balance between innovation and safety, ensuring new asset types enhance rather than endanger the protocol.
