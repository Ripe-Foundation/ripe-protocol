# Collateral Assets

Ripe Protocol transforms DeFi lending by accepting virtually any tokenized asset as collateral. Unlike traditional lending platforms that support only a handful of blue-chip assets, Ripe embraces the full spectrum of blockchain innovationâ€”from established cryptocurrencies to emerging tokenized real-world assets.

## Why Collateral Matters

When you borrow in DeFi, you lock up assets as collateral to secure your loan. The value and type of collateral you provide determines how much you can borrow and at what terms. Ripe's approach is flexible: supporting everything from blue-chip assets to emerging tokens, with yield-bearing assets maintaining their productive nature even while serving as collateral.

## The Ripe Difference

Traditional lending protocols force you to choose between different isolated markets. Have WETH and want to borrow? That's one position. Have cbBTC too? That's a separate position with its own risks. Ripe changes this paradigm:

- **One Loan, Many Assets**: All your collateral backs a single loan position
- **Portfolio Approach**: Diversification reduces liquidation risk
- **Yield Preservation**: Yield-bearing assets continue earning while serving as collateral
- **Future-Ready**: New asset types integrate seamlessly

## How We Support Diverse Assets Safely

**"How can Ripe accept risky assets like memecoins or NFTs as collateral?"**

This is possible thanks to our sophisticated liquidation system. While other protocols restrict themselves to "safe" assets, Ripe's three-phase liquidation mechanism can handle virtually any asset type while maintaining system security. The combination of:
- Isolated risk per user (your risky assets don't affect others)
- Multiple liquidation mechanisms (gentle to aggressive)
- Customized parameters per asset type

...enables us to safely support assets other protocols won't touch. Learn more about [how our liquidation system enables asset diversity](../liquidations/README.md#why-liquidations-enable-asset-diversity).
