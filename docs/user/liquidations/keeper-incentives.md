# Keeper Incentives

Keepers are bots and traders who trigger liquidations instantly when positions become unhealthy. They earn 1-2% of your debt as payment.

## Why Keepers Exist

Without keepers, unhealthy positions would sit unliquidated for hours or days, accumulating losses. Keepers ensure:
- **Instant liquidation** when you cross the threshold
- **24/7 monitoring** of all positions
- **Competition** that drives efficient execution

Think of them as DeFi's emergency responders—always watching, ready to act.

## What You Pay

Keeper fees are part of your total liquidation cost:

```
Example $10,000 liquidation:
- Keeper fee: 1.5% = $150
- Base liquidation fee: 5% = $500
- Your total cost: $650
```

**Fee structure:**
- Minimum: $50-100 (small positions still get liquidated)
- Standard: 1-2% of debt
- Market stress: Up to 5% during crashes

## Why It's Worth It

**With keepers**: Position liquidated in minutes → Debt stops growing
**Without keepers**: Position stays unhealthy for hours → Debt keeps accumulating

That 1-2% fee saves you from much larger losses.

## Key Points

1. **Keepers compete** - First to liquidate wins the fee
2. **You benefit** - Fast execution minimizes your losses  
3. **Small cost** - 1-2% prevents larger damage
4. **Always active** - Works 24/7, even during market chaos

Keeper incentives ensure liquidations happen fast, protecting both you and the protocol.
