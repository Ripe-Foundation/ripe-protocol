# Dutch Auctions

Dutch auctions are Ripe's final liquidation methodâ€”when other mechanisms can't handle your collateral, it goes to auction where anyone can buy it at an increasing discount over time.

## Auction Mechanism

Dutch auctions implement time-based progressive discounting:

1. **Delayed start** - Configurable delay period after liquidation
2. **Linear progression** - Discount increases from start to maximum
3. **GREEN settlement** - All purchases require GREEN tokens
4. **Termination** - Ends when all collateral sold, debt repaid, or maximum discount reached

### How Payment Works

Dutch auctions are instant and flexible:
- **Instant settlement** - No waiting for auction to "end" 
- **Partial purchases allowed** - Buyers can purchase any amount (for fungible/ERC20 assets)
- **Buyer pays GREEN** - Must pay in GREEN tokens at current discount rate
- **GREEN is burned** - Those GREEN tokens are permanently destroyed
- **Your debt reduced** - The burned GREEN amount reduces your outstanding debt
- **You keep remainder** - Any collateral value above debt stays yours

For fungible assets like WETH or USDC, there's no concept of "winning" - anyone can buy any portion at the current discount rate until all collateral is sold or debt is repaid.

## Real Example

```
Your 5 WETH going to auction
Market price: $2,000 each
Your debt: $8,000

Hour 0: $1,900 per WETH (5% off)
Hour 1: $1,833 per WETH (8% off)
Hour 2: $1,767 per WETH (12% off)
Hour 3: $1,700 per WETH (15% off)
```

Multiple buyers at Hour 3:
- Buyer A: Purchases 2 WETH for 3,400 GREEN
- Buyer B: Purchases 1.5 WETH for 2,550 GREEN  
- Buyer C: Purchases 1.5 WETH for 2,550 GREEN

Total outcome:
- GREEN burned: 8,500 (all purchases combined)
- Your debt: Reduced from $8,000 to $0
- You receive: $500 worth of leftover collateral
- Auction ends: No more WETH to sell

## Auction Triggers

Collateral enters the auction system when:
- **No stability pool configuration** exists for the asset
- **Stability pool capacity exhausted** during liquidation
- **Asset configuration** specifies auction-only liquidation
- **Partial liquidation** leaves remainder after stability pool swaps
- **Keeper initiation** after liquidation with auction flag

## Cost to You

Dutch auctions typically cost more than stability pools:

**Stability Pools**: Your liquidation fee only (e.g., 6%)
**Dutch Auctions**: Your liquidation fee + auction discount (e.g., 6% + 15% = 21%)

The longer the auction runs, the bigger your loss.

## Auction Participants

Dutch auctions attract various market participants:
- Arbitrageurs seeking immediate profit opportunities
- Investors accumulating assets at discounts
- Protocol treasuries acquiring strategic positions
- General market participants with GREEN holdings

### Exception: Permissioned Assets

For whitelisted assets (like tokenized real estate or securities):
- **Only whitelisted addresses** can participate in auctions
- **Compliance maintained** throughout liquidation
- **Smaller buyer pool** may mean longer auctions
- **Same discount mechanics** apply to qualified buyers

## Auction Parameters

Each asset type has configured auction settings:

- **Delay blocks**: Time before auction starts (prevents instant arbitrage)
- **Start discount**: Initial percentage below market (e.g., 2-5%)
- **Maximum discount**: Final percentage if no buyers (e.g., 20-50%)
- **Duration blocks**: Total time for discount progression

Parameter selection reflects asset liquidity, volatility, and market depth.

## Phase 3 Priority

Dutch auctions are the last resort:
1. **Phase 1**: Burn your GREEN/sGREEN, transfer stablecoins
2. **Phase 2**: Swap with stability pools
3. **Phase 3**: Auction remaining collateral

## Liquidation Flow Integration

Auctions process collateral remaining after earlier phases:
- Phase 1 mechanisms reduce debt through burns and transfers
- Phase 2 stability pools handle liquid assets
- Phase 3 auctions clear remaining collateral at market-discovered prices

Excess collateral value returns to the original position holder after debt settlement.

## Auction Characteristics

Dutch auctions serve as the final liquidation mechanism with:
- Activation only when other methods cannot process collateral
- Progressive discounting over time
- Open participation for GREEN holders
- Higher effective costs than stability pool liquidations
- Guaranteed eventual liquidation through maximum discounts

## Auction System Design

Dutch auctions provide a market-based liquidation mechanism when other methods are unavailable or insufficient. The time-based discount structure creates economic incentives for market participants while ensuring all positions can eventually be liquidated.

The auction mechanism operates as the protocol's final liquidation method, guaranteeing debt resolution through progressive discounting that attracts buyers at market-clearing prices.
