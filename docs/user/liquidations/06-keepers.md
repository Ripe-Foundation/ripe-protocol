# Keepers

Keepers are bots that trigger liquidations for profit. They monitor all positions and liquidate the moment you breach thresholds.

## How Liquidation Keepers Work

**Continuous Monitoring**
- Track every borrowing position in real-time
- Calculate health factors constantly
- Identify positions crossing liquidation thresholds

**Instant Execution**
- Call the liquidate function within blocks of eligibility
- Protocol automatically handles all asset routing
- Compete with other keepers - fastest wins

**Profit Motive**
- Earn 1-2% of liquidated debt as base reward
- Additional profits from buying discounted collateral
- Gas costs covered by minimum reward thresholds

## Why This Matters to You

**Speed**: Competition ensures you're liquidated immediately when eligible - no grace period

**Efficiency**: Keepers ensure liquidations happen instantly, minimizing bad debt

**Reliability**: Multiple keepers mean liquidations happen 24/7 without fail

## The Competition Dynamic

Dozens of keepers race to liquidate positions:
- First keeper to execute gets all rewards
- This competition drives near-instant liquidations
- No single keeper can control or delay the process

Your position's safety depends entirely on maintaining collateral above thresholds - keepers will liquidate the moment you cross the line.

Keepers create an automated, decentralized liquidation system where profit incentives ensure immediate execution without human intervention.
