# Ripe Protocol: Where Your Entire Portfolio Becomes Productive Capital

Welcome to Ripe Protocol — a lending platform that transforms how DeFi handles collateral. Instead of juggling multiple isolated positions, your entire portfolio works as one, backing a single loan with the combined strength of all your assets.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional DeFi lending forces impossible choices:

**Isolated Positions** (MakerDAO, Liquity)
- ETH vault here, WBTC vault there
- Each position managed separately
- Liquidation cascades risk your entire portfolio

**Pooled Risk** (Aave, Compound)  
- Your collateral backs everyone's loans
- Limited to "safe" blue-chip assets
- One bad actor affects all users

**Fragmented Markets** (Morpho, Euler)
- Better rates but still isolated positions
- Each market needs its own liquidity
- Innovation limited by conservative parameters

## The Ripe Solution: Unified Multi-Collateral Lending

```
Your Portfolio:              Traditional:           Ripe:
┌─────────────┐             ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│ 5 ETH       │ ──────────> │ ETH Loan #1 │       │             │
│ 2 WBTC      │ ──────────> │ WBTC Loan #2│       │  ONE LOAN   │
│ 10K USDC    │ ──────────> │ USDC Loan #3│  ───> │  GREEN      │

└─────────────┘             └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
                            5 positions to          1 unified
                            manage, limited         position,
                            assets                  everything works

# GREEN: The Stablecoin That Works Harder

GREEN is Ripe Protocol's overcollateralized stablecoin — a digital dollar that maintains rock-solid stability while powering an entire ecosystem of yield opportunities, liquidation profits, and financial tools. Unlike traditional stablecoins that sit idle in your wallet, GREEN actively participates in DeFi, earning yield through [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md), protecting the protocol through [stability pools](05-stability-pools.md), and maintaining its peg through multiple autonomous mechanisms that work 24/7.

## Why GREEN Exists

### The Problem with Current Stablecoin Borrowing

Traditional lending protocols force inefficient choices that limit how you can use stablecoins:

**Isolated Positions (MakerDAO/Liquity Model)**:
- Open ETH vault → Borrow DAI
- Open WBTC vault → Manage separate loan
- Add new asset? → Yet another position
- Result: Portfolio fragmentation, constant juggling

**Pooled Risk (Aave/Compound Model)**:
- Limited to "safe" assets only
- Your collateral backs everyone's loans
- One bad actor affects all users
- Result: Restricted innovation, systemic risk

**Isolated Money Markets (Morpho/Euler Model)**:
- Deposit ETH → One USDC loan
- Deposit WBTC → Another separate USDC loan
- Multiple positions to track and manage
- Each market needs lenders providing capital
- Result: Portfolio fragmentation AND rate inefficiency

### Ripe's Solution: Unified Multi-Collateral Borrowing

GREEN represents a fundamental rethink of stablecoin creation:

```
Traditional:  ETH → DAI Position 1
              WBTC → DAI Position 2
              USDC → Can't use

Ripe:         ETH + WBTC + USDC + stETH + NFTs + Anything
              ↓ (all combined)
              One GREEN Loan at Weighted Terms
```

Your entire portfolio — from blue-chip crypto to yield-bearing tokens, from stablecoins to NFTs — backs a single GREEN loan. This creates unmatched capital efficiency while keeping your risk isolated from other users.

### Complementary, Not Competitive

While these protocols have borrowing limitations, they excel at generating yield — and Ripe turns their yield-bearing tokens into powerful collateral. Instead of choosing between earning yield OR borrowing, you can do both:

- **Aave aTokens**: Earn lending yield while using as Ripe collateral
- **Compound cTokens**: Your supplied assets keep compounding
- **Morpho positions**: Optimized rates become productive collateral
- **Maker sDAI**: Savings rate continues while backing GREEN loans

The best strategy? Lend on these protocols for yield, then use those yield-bearing positions as collateral on Ripe. You get their yields AND our capital efficiency — truly the best of both worlds.

### Built for the Entire Ecosystem

GREEN isn't just another stablecoin. It's the cornerstone of Ripe Protocol:

```

## How GREEN Works

### Creation Through Borrowing

Every GREEN token represents real value locked in Ripe Protocol:

1. **Deposit Collateral**: Lock any supported asset (ETH, WBTC, stablecoins, etc.)
2. **Borrow GREEN**: Mint new GREEN against your collateral
3. **Overcollateralized Always**: Minimum 110% backing, often much higher
4. **Pay Interest**: Dynamic rates that respond to market conditions
5. **Origination Fee (Daowry)**: One-time 0.5% fee that flows to sGREEN holders

**Example Multi-Asset Borrowing**:
```
Your Unified Portfolio:
- 5 ETH worth $10,000 (70% LTV = $7,000 borrowing power)
- 10,000 USDC (90% LTV = $9,000 borrowing power)  
- 2 stETH worth $4,000 (85% LTV = $3,400 borrowing power)
- 1M PEPE worth $1,000 (50% LTV = $500 borrowing power)
- 1 Bored Ape worth $50,000 (40% LTV = $20,000 borrowing power)

Total Borrowing Power: $39,900 GREEN
Single Loan, Single Interest Rate, All Assets Working Together
```

### Destruction Through Repayment

GREEN supply contracts automatically when loans are repaid:

1. **Send GREEN**: Return borrowed amount plus interest
2. **Burn Forever**: GREEN is permanently destroyed
3. **Unlock Collateral**: Get your assets back proportionally
4. **Supply Equilibrium**: Total GREEN always matches total debt

This elegant mechanism ensures GREEN supply expands and contracts with real borrowing demand — no algorithmic games or manual interventions needed.

## The Five Pillars of Stability

GREEN maintains its $1 peg through multiple interconnected mechanisms that activate automatically based on market conditions. Notably, GREEN features two distinct redemption mechanisms that create powerful arbitrage loops, ensuring the peg is defended from multiple angles:

### 1. Overcollateralization Foundation

The bedrock of GREEN's stability:
- **150%+ Average**: Most positions maintain much higher collateral ratios
- **Extreme Asset Diversity**: Unlike other stables limited to ETH/WBTC, GREEN is backed by everything from stETH earning staking yields to PEPE memes to tokenized Tesla stock
- **Portfolio Effect**: When one asset drops, others may rise — true diversification
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous health checks on all positions
- **Buffer Zones**: Multiple warning levels before liquidation

### 2. Dynamic Interest Rate Response

When GREEN trades below peg, borrowing rates increase to encourage repayment:

**Normal Conditions (Balanced Pool)**:
- 50% GREEN / 50% USDC in reference pool
- Borrowers pay only their weighted base rates
- No dynamic adjustments needed

**Below Peg Response (GREEN Weak)**:
- Pool imbalanced with >60% GREEN (too much GREEN supply)
- Dynamic rate multipliers activate progressively
- Higher rates incentivize borrowers to repay (buy GREEN)
- Repayment creates buying pressure, restoring peg

**Above Peg Response (GREEN Strong)**:
- Normal base rates apply (no increase needed)
- Endaoment can mint GREEN to add liquidity
- Increased supply brings price back down

**Emergency Rate Escalation**:
When GREEN exceeds 60% in reference pools:
- Base rates multiply progressively (1.5x to 3x based on severity)
- Time-based penalties accumulate (+0.01% per 100 blocks = ~3.3 minutes on Base)
- Creates powerful incentive to restore balance through repayment

### 3. Direct Redemption Mechanism

Redemptions create an automatic arbitrage loop that restores GREEN's peg whenever it trades below $1:

**The $1 Guarantee**:
- GREEN can always be redeemed for exactly $1 worth of collateral
- Targets only positions in the "Redemption Zone" (below redemption threshold)
- No committees, no voting, no delays — instant execution
- Creates a hard floor for GREEN's market price

**How Arbitrage Restores the Peg**:
```
GREEN trading at $0.97? Here's what happens:

1. Arbitrageurs spot the 3% discount
2. Buy 10,000 GREEN for $9,700 on the market
3. Instantly redeem for $10,000 worth of collateral
4. Profit: $300 risk-free
5. This buying pressure pushes GREEN back to $1
```

**Why This Works Every Time**:
- **Guaranteed Profitability**: As long as GREEN < $1, arbitrage is profitable
- **Instant Settlement**: No waiting periods or lockups
- **Targeted Redemptions**: Only positions in Redemption Zone (approaching liquidation) can be redeemed
- **Always Available**: Protocol ensures sufficient redeemable positions exist during market stress
- **Self-Reinforcing**: The worse the depeg, the bigger the profit opportunity

**Market Mechanics**:
- Below $0.99: Small arbitrage attracts traders
- Below $0.97: Significant profits draw institutional arbitrageurs  
- Below $0.95: Massive opportunity creates buying frenzy
- Result: GREEN rarely stays below peg for long

This mechanism works 24/7 without any manual intervention, creating relentless buying pressure whenever GREEN weakens.

### 4. Stability Pool Redemption Mechanism

A second powerful redemption path exists through [stability pools](05-stability-pools.md) that hold liquidated collateral:

**How Pool Redemptions Work**:
- Stability pools accumulate ETH, WBTC, and other assets from liquidations
- Any GREEN holder can redeem 1 GREEN for exactly $1 worth of these assets
- No restrictions — available to anyone, anytime pools hold collateral
- Creates instant arbitrage when GREEN trades below peg

**Why This Matters for Stability**:
```
GREEN at $0.96? Two redemption paths:
1. Redeem from at-risk borrowers (Redemption Zone)
2. Redeem from stability pool collateral

Double the arbitrage opportunities = Stronger peg defense
```

**Additional Benefits**:
- **Deeper Liquidity**: More redemption sources during stress
- **Always Available**: Liquidations constantly replenish pool collateral
- **Fair Exchange**: Always 1:1 USD value with no slippage
- **Supports Depositors**: Redeemed GREEN becomes a protective buffer in pools

### 5. Endaoment Treasury Operations

The [Endaoment](11-endaoment.md) serves as GREEN's financial fortress — a protocol-owned treasury with vast capabilities to defend the peg:

**Capital Arsenal from Bond Sales**:
- Bond proceeds provide stablecoin reserves for immediate deployment
- Treasury assets work 24/7 across DeFi earning yield
- Growing war chest ensures firepower during any market condition
- No reliance on external capital or emergency fundraising

**Automated Stabilizer System**:
```
The 50/50 Rule in Action:

GREEN below peg (pool >50% GREEN)?
→ Remove excess GREEN liquidity
→ Burn GREEN tokens permanently
→ Create scarcity that drives price up

GREEN above peg (pool <50% GREEN)?
→ Mint new GREEN (tracked as debt)
→ Add liquidity to deepen markets
→ Increase supply to moderate price
```

**Liquidity Management Powers**:
- **Multi-DEX Operations**: Deploy liquidity across Curve, Uniswap, Aerodrome simultaneously
- **Concentrated Positions**: Use Uniswap V3 or Aero Slipstream for capital-efficient price support
- **Partner Programs**: Mint GREEN paired with partner assets for deeper markets
- **Instant Rebalancing**: Move capital between pools in single transactions

**Strategic Market Making**:
- Can provide buy-side support when GREEN weak
- Can provide sell-side liquidity when GREEN strong
- Profits from spreads flow back to treasury
- Self-funded operations through yield generation

**Why This Matters**:
- **Deep Resources**: Treasury can mint GREEN when needed (always tracked as debt)
- **Multiple Fronts**: Operates across all major DEXes simultaneously
- **Always Active**: No governance votes or delays — instant response
- **Self-Strengthening**: Every intervention generates fees that grow the treasury

The Endaoment transforms from passive treasury to active market participant, with the resources and authority to maintain GREEN's peg against any market conditions.

## Additional GREEN Ecosystem Features

### Keeper Network Protection
- Automated bots monitor all GREEN loans 24/7
- Trigger liquidations when positions become unsafe
- Keepers earn 0.1-0.5% rewards (paid in GREEN)
- Minimizes bad debt through rapid liquidation execution

### Bad Debt Resolution
If extreme conditions create bad debt, the protocol can sell [bonds](10-bonds.md) to raise recovery funds. This mints RIPE beyond the 1B cap (e.g., becoming 1.001B), with dilution shared proportionally by all holders — ensuring GREEN always remains fully backed.

### Protocol-Wide Integration
- GREEN is the only borrowable asset in Ripe Protocol
- All liquidations settle in GREEN
- Fee flows strengthen the ecosystem
- Designed for maximum composability with DeFi

## GREEN Throughout Ripe Protocol

### Transform to sGREEN for Automatic Yield

[sGREEN](04-sgreen.md) is GREEN's yield-bearing twin:
- **Set and Forget**: Deposit GREEN, receive sGREEN
- **Auto-Compounding**: Value grows through exchange rate, not rebasing
- **Protocol Revenue**: Captures fees from borrowing, liquidations, and more
- **Instant Liquidity**: Redeem for GREEN anytime
- **Use Everywhere**: Stability pools accept sGREEN for enhanced returns

### Participate in Stability Pools

Deploy sGREEN or GREEN LP tokens for liquidation profits:
- **Triple Yield**: Base sGREEN rate + liquidation profits + RIPE rewards
- **Guaranteed Discounts**: Buy collateral 5-15% below market
- **Support Protocol**: Your deposits enable smooth liquidations
- **Flexible Withdrawal**: No lockups or penalties

### Enable Borrowing Options

When taking loans, receive GREEN flexibly:
- **Direct GREEN**: Standard stablecoin for any use
- **Auto-sGREEN**: Start earning immediately on borrowed funds
- **Stability Pool Entry**: Maximum yield from day one

### Earn RIPE Block Rewards

Multiple ways to earn RIPE through GREEN:
- **Borrowing GREEN**: Larger, longer-term loans earn more rewards
- **Stability Pool Deposits**: sGREEN and GREEN LP deposits earn additional RIPE
- **Time-Weighted System**: Points accumulate based on position size × time
- **Offset Costs**: Rewards help reduce effective borrowing rates or boost stability pool returns

## GREEN vs The Competition: A Clear Winner

When you need to borrow stablecoins, GREEN offers fundamental advantages:

**vs Centralized Stables (USDC/USDT)**:
- Can't borrow USDC/USDT — you must buy them
- GREEN: Mint by borrowing against any asset you own
- Bonus: GREEN earns yield via sGREEN, USDC sits idle

**vs Traditional Crypto Stables (DAI/LUSD)**:
- DAI: Separate vaults for each collateral type
- LUSD: Only accepts ETH (or similar) as collateral
- GREEN: One loan backed by your entire portfolio

**vs Algorithmic Experiments (UST)**:
- No real backing = inevitable collapse
- GREEN: Every token 150%+ overcollateralized

**The Key Difference**: GREEN is built for borrowers who want to use their entire portfolio efficiently. Whether you hold ETH, stablecoins, NFTs, tokenized stocks or emerging tokens, everything works together to back a single, manageable loan position.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Case 1: The Yield Farmer
*Sarah has $50,000 USDC earning nothing*

1. Deposits USDC as collateral (90% LTV available)
2. Borrows $40,000 GREEN
3. Converts to sGREEN earning 6% APY
4. Deposits sGREEN in stability pool earning additional 12% APY
5. **Net Result**: 18% yield on borrowed funds minus 4% borrow cost = 14% profit

### Case 2: The Arbitrageur
*Alex spots GREEN trading at $0.96*

1. Buys 10,000 GREEN for $9,600
2. Finds positions eligible for redemption
3. Redeems GREEN for $10,000 worth of ETH
4. **Instant Profit**: $400 (4.2% return)
5. **Side Effect**: Helps restore GREEN peg

### Case 3: The DeFi Power User
*Jordan maximizes capital efficiency with diverse assets*

1. Deposits complete portfolio:
   - 5 ETH + 0.5 WBTC (blue-chip crypto)
   - 10,000 USDC + 5,000 USDS (stablecoins)
   - 3 stETH (earning staking yield while collateralized)
   - 2M PEPE (speculative but still productive)
   - 1 Pudgy Penguin NFT (floor value collateral)
2. Gets single GREEN loan combining all assets' value
3. Uses GREEN across DeFi while assets keep earning
4. **Benefit**: Every asset productive, one position to manage

## The Bottom Line

GREEN represents the next evolution in stablecoin design — combining the proven safety of overcollateralization with modern capital efficiency and seamless ecosystem integration. Whether you're borrowing against assets, earning yield through sGREEN, participating in liquidations, or simply using a reliable dollar instrument, GREEN provides unmatched utility without compromising stability.

# Collateral Assets

Ripe Protocol transforms traditional lending by creating a unified multi-collateral system where all your deposited assets work together to back a single GREEN loan. Instead of managing multiple isolated positions, your entire portfolio — from stablecoins to blue-chip crypto to emerging tokens — combines into one powerful borrowing position. Every asset you deposit contributes to your total borrowing capacity, creating unprecedented capital efficiency while maintaining individual risk isolation.

## Why Ripe's Approach is Different

### The Problem with Traditional Lending

Most DeFi protocols force you into one of two suboptimal models:

**Isolated Markets**: Each asset creates a separate loan position
- Deposit ETH → Manage one position
- Deposit USDC → Manage another position  
- One liquidation doesn't help the others
- Complex management across multiple positions

**Pooled Lending**: Shared risk limits asset acceptance
- Only blue-chip assets allowed
- Your deposits back everyone's loans
- Bad actors affect all depositors
- Innovation stifled by conservative parameters

### Ripe's Solution: Best of Both Worlds

Ripe combines portfolio efficiency with individual risk isolation:

```
Your Multi-Asset Portfolio = One GREEN Loan
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ETH    USDC    WBTC    PEPE    stETH     │
│  $10k   $5k     $15k    $100    $50k      │
│  80%    90%     80%     50%     85%       │ <- Individual LTVs
│  ↓      ↓       ↓       ↓       ↓         │
│  ═══════════════════════════════════════  │
│           COMBINED COLLATERAL             │
│           Total Value: $80,100            │
│           Borrowing Power: $67,585        │
│                     ↓                     │
│         SINGLE GREEN LOAN POSITION        │
│         Up to $67,585 GREEN               │
│                                           │
│  • One loan, one interest rate            │
│  • One health factor to monitor           │
│  • All assets contribute to backing       │
│  • Your risk isolated from others         │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This architecture enables support for virtually any asset while maintaining protocol safety — your collateral backs only your loans, not a shared pool.

## The Universe of Supported Assets

Ripe's extensible architecture can support a vast and growing universe of tokenized value:

**1. Stablecoins** - The foundation of stability
- **USDC, USDT**: Major centralized stablecoins with deep liquidity
- **USDS**: Decentralized stablecoin from Sky Protocol
- **Yield-bearing stables**: Interest-earning stable assets
- Typically offer 80-90% LTV ratios due to price stability

**2. Blue-Chip Crypto** - Established digital assets
- **WETH**: Wrapped Ethereum, the DeFi standard
- **WBTC/cbBTC**: Bitcoin representations on Ethereum
- **Major DeFi tokens**: AAVE, UNI, CRV, and other protocol tokens
- **Layer 1 tokens**: SOL, AVAX, MATIC (when bridged)

## How Deposits Work

### The Deposit Process

1. **Asset Selection**: Choose from any supported token
2. **Automatic Vault Routing**: Protocol selects optimal vault type
3. **Instant Activation**: Start earning rewards immediately
4. **Portfolio Building**: Add more assets anytime

### Vault Types Explained

Ripe automatically routes your deposits to specialized vaults:

**Simple Erc20 Vaults** - Standard tokens (ETH, USDC, most assets)
- Direct 1:1 balance tracking
- Simple deposit/withdraw mechanics
- Most common vault type

**Rebase Erc20 Vaults** - Yield-bearing assets (stETH, aTokens)
- Share-based accounting preserves yields
- Compound earnings while deposited
- No opportunity cost from collateralization

**Special Purpose Vaults**
- **[Ripe Gov Vault](08-governance.md)**: Lock RIPE tokens for governance power
- **[Stability Pools](05-stability-pools.md)**: Earn from liquidations with sGREEN/LP tokens
- **Future Vaults**: NFTs, RWAs, and emerging asset types

### The Power of Extensibility

Ripe's vault system is designed to be infinitely extensible. As new asset types emerge or special requirements arise, the protocol can deploy new vault implementations without disrupting existing operations:

- **Custom Logic**: Each vault type can implement specific behaviors for its assets
- **Future-Proof**: Support for assets that don't exist yet
- **Seamless Integration**: New vaults plug into the existing ecosystem
- **Innovation Ready**: From NFT fractionalization to real-world asset settlements

This extensibility ensures Ripe can adapt to any tokenized value the future brings — whether it's gaming assets requiring special metadata, regulated securities needing compliance hooks, or entirely new token standards we haven't imagined yet.

The protocol automatically selects the right vault — you just deposit.

### Deposit Limits and Controls

Each asset has configurable parameters that protect the stability of GREEN, our stablecoin:

**Why Limits Matter**

Since deposited assets serve as collateral backing GREEN loans, the protocol must prevent any single asset from becoming too dominant. If 90% of GREEN were backed by one volatile asset, its price swings could destabilize the entire system. Limits ensure diversified, resilient backing.

**Per-User Limits**
- Maximum deposit per user per asset
- Prevents whale dominance in specific assets
- Ensures broad distribution of risk
- Maintains fair access for all participants

**Global Limits**  
- Protocol-wide caps per asset type
- Controls each asset's percentage of total GREEN backing
- Gradual increases as assets prove stability and liquidity
- Protects stablecoin integrity during market stress

**Minimum Balances**
- Small position requirements (often ~$100)
- Prevents dust accumulation
- Ensures meaningful participation
- Reduces computational overhead

These limits adapt over time through governance, balancing growth opportunities with prudent risk management. As assets demonstrate stability and liquidity deepens, limits can expand while maintaining GREEN's robust backing.

### Multi-Asset Advantages

Building a diversified collateral portfolio provides:

1. **Reduced Liquidation Risk**: Asset correlation protection
2. **Optimized Borrowing Power**: Each asset contributes its best LTV
3. **Simplified Management**: One position, one health factor
4. **Flexible Composition**: Add/remove assets as needed

## Making Withdrawals

### Withdrawal Mechanics

Withdrawals respect your overall position health:

1. **Free Collateral**: Withdraw assets above borrowing needs
2. **Health Check**: Ensure position remains safe
3. **Instant Processing**: No waiting periods or queues
4. **Partial or Full**: Take what you need, leave the rest

### Understanding Available Withdrawals

Your withdrawal capacity depends on:
- **Unused collateral** not backing loans
- **Asset-specific LTVs** determining borrowing power
- **Current debt levels** and interest accrued
- **Overall health factor** maintaining safety

Example:
```
Deposited: $10,000 ETH
Borrowed: $5,000 GREEN (at 80% LTV)
Required: $6,250 collateral
Available to withdraw: $3,750 worth of ETH
```

## Earning While Deposited

### Automatic Reward Accumulation

Every deposit earns RIPE rewards through the protocol's points system:

```
Points = Deposit Value × Blocks Held
Share = Your Points / Total Points
Rewards = Your Share × Emissions
```

Time matters as much as size — smaller deposits held longer can out-earn whale positions.

### Reward Categories

**General Depositors** - All deposits earn base rewards
- USD-weighted fair distribution
- No special requirements
- Passive income on all assets

**Vote Depositors** - Community-selected bonus rewards
- Higher allocations for chosen assets
- Governance participation benefits
- Strategic deposit opportunities

**Special Rewards** - Enhanced earnings in specific vaults
- [Stability pool](05-stability-pools.md) deposits earning dual yields
- [Governance Vault](08-governance.md) staking with multipliers
- Future special purpose incentives

For a detailed exploration of the RIPE rewards system, including emission schedules, point calculations, and maximization strategies, see [RIPE Block Rewards](06-ripe-rewards.md).

# Borrowing on Ripe: Unlock Liquidity Without Selling

Ripe Protocol enables borrowing [GREEN stablecoins](01-green-stablecoin.md) against your [deposited collateral](02-collateral-assets.md) through an automated system that weighs risks, adjusts rates dynamically, and maintains protocol stability. This isn't just another lending platform — it's a sophisticated credit engine that transforms idle assets into productive capital while preserving your exposure to upside potential.

## Why Borrow on Ripe

### Capital Efficiency Without Compromise

When you deposit assets into Ripe vaults, they don't just sit idle. The protocol evaluates your collateral portfolio and extends credit lines based on weighted risk parameters. This means:

- **Maintain asset exposure** while accessing liquidity
- **Avoid taxable events** from selling appreciated assets  
- **Compound yields** by borrowing at one rate and earning at another
- **Access instant liquidity** without credit checks or applications

The borrowing system serves as the demand driver for [GREEN](01-green-stablecoin.md), creating natural use cases that strengthen the stablecoin's utility and adoption. GREEN is minted when you borrow and burned when you repay, maintaining supply-demand equilibrium.

## How Borrowing Works

### Unified Position Structure

In Ripe Protocol, all your collateral across all vaults backs a single, unified loan position. You don't have separate loans for each asset — instead, your entire collateral portfolio supports one consolidated debt position. This design simplifies management and maximizes capital efficiency.

### The Credit Calculation Engine

Ripe's credit engine performs sophisticated calculations to determine your borrowing capacity:

1. **Collateral Valuation**: Each deposited asset is valued using real-time price feeds
2. **LTV Application**: Asset-specific loan-to-value ratios determine borrowing power
3. **Term Weighting**: Multiple assets create weighted average terms
4. **Risk Assessment**: Dynamic adjustments based on market conditions

This multi-factor approach ensures fair credit access while maintaining system security.

### Weighted Debt Terms Explained

When you deposit multiple collateral types, Ripe doesn't just average your terms — it weights them based on each asset's contribution to your total borrowing power. Here's how it works:

**Example Portfolio:**
```
ETH: $10,000 value × 70% LTV = $7,000 borrowing power
WBTC: $5,000 value × 65% LTV = $3,250 borrowing power  
USDC: $15,000 value × 90% LTV = $13,500 borrowing power

Total Borrowing Power = $23,750
```

**Weighted Interest Rate Calculation:**
```
ETH weight: $7,000 / $23,750 = 29.5%
WBTC weight: $3,250 / $23,750 = 13.7%
USDC weight: $13,500 / $23,750 = 56.8%

If rates are: ETH 6%, WBTC 7%, USDC 4%
Your rate = (6% × 29.5%) + (7% × 13.7%) + (4% × 56.8%) = 5.0%
```

This weighting applies to all debt terms: interest rates, liquidation thresholds, redemption thresholds, and origination fees. Assets with higher borrowing power have proportionally greater influence on your overall terms.

## Key Safety Thresholds

### Understanding Your Risk Levels

Three critical thresholds govern your position's safety. Understanding how they work — and how they work together — is essential for managing risk.

### The Three Thresholds Explained

**1. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio: Your Borrowing Limit**

The LTV determines your maximum borrowing capacity as a percentage of collateral value.

- **What it means**: You can borrow up to this percentage of your collateral
- **Direction**: Higher debt OR lower collateral value → Higher LTV usage (risky)
- **Example**: 70% LTV on $10,000 collateral = $7,000 maximum borrow

**2. Redemption Threshold: The Warning Zone**

When your position becomes eligible for collateral redemption by GREEN holders.

- **What it means**: Other users can pay off your debt and take equivalent collateral
- **How it's calculated**: Position at risk when collateral < debt ÷ redemption threshold
- **Example with 80% threshold**:
  ```
  Your debt: $8,000
  Redemption triggers when collateral < $10,000
  (Because $8,000 ÷ 0.80 = $10,000)
  ```
- **Purpose**: Provides market-based deleveraging and early warning before [liquidation](07-liquidations.md)

**3. Liquidation Threshold: The Danger Zone**

The critical point where forced [liquidation](07-liquidations.md) begins to protect the protocol.

- **What it means**: Your position will be liquidated
- **How it's calculated**: Liquidation when collateral < debt ÷ liquidation threshold  
- **Example with 90% threshold**:
  ```
  Your debt: $8,000
  Liquidation triggers when collateral < $8,889
  (Because $8,000 ÷ 0.90 = $8,889)
  ```
- **No escape**: Once triggered, liquidation proceeds automatically

### How Thresholds Work Together: A Visual Guide

Here's a unified view of how all three thresholds create different risk zones:

```

└─ Your Current Collateral: $10,000
   (167% collateral ratio - very safe!)
```

**Understanding Each Zone:**

**🟢 SAFE ZONE (Collateral > $8,571)**
- **Status**: Healthy position with borrowing capacity
- **Actions Available**: Can borrow up to $7,000 total
- **Risk Level**: None - full flexibility
- **What to do**: Normal operations

**🟡 CAUTION ZONE (Collateral $8,571 - $7,500)**
- **Status**: Over max LTV but still protected
- **Actions Available**: Cannot borrow more; can repay/add collateral
- **Risk Level**: Medium - approaching danger
- **What to do**: Consider reducing debt or adding collateral

**🟠 REDEMPTION ZONE (Collateral $7,500 - $6,667)**
- **Status**: Eligible for [redemption](07-liquidations.md#redemption-the-first-line-of-defense)
- **Actions Available**: Anyone can pay your debt for collateral
- **Risk Level**: High - active intervention needed
- **What to do**: Urgently repay debt or add collateral

**🔴 LIQUIDATION ZONE (Collateral < $6,667)**
- **Status**: Automatic [liquidation](07-liquidations.md) triggered
- **Actions Available**: None - process is automatic
- **Risk Level**: Critical - position being closed
- **What to do**: Learn from experience for next time

### The Critical Inverse Relationship

Unlike LTV which calculates forward (debt as % of collateral), redemption and liquidation thresholds work inversely — they define the **minimum collateral required** for a given debt level.

**Quick Reference - Two Ways to View the Same Thresholds:**

| Threshold | Forward View (LTV) | Inverse View (Min Collateral) | Example ($6,000 debt) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Max Borrow** | Can borrow up to 70% of collateral | Need 143% collateral coverage | Need $8,571+ collateral |
| **Redemption** | Triggered at 80% debt-to-collateral | Need 125% collateral coverage | Need $7,500+ collateral |
| **Liquidation** | Triggered at 90% debt-to-collateral | Need 111% collateral coverage | Need $6,667+ collateral |

**What This Means:**
- As debt grows from interest → You approach thresholds
- As collateral value drops → You approach thresholds  
- Higher threshold percentages = Tighter requirements = Less room for error

Understanding this inverse relationship helps you monitor the right metrics and take action before it's too late.

**Pro Tip - Monitor Your Health Factor:**
```
Health Factor = Current Collateral Value ÷ Liquidation Collateral Required

Example: $10,000 collateral ÷ $6,667 required = 1.50 health factor
- Above 1.5 = Very safe (green)
- 1.2 to 1.5 = Monitor closely (yellow)
- 1.0 to 1.2 = Take action now (orange)
- Below 1.0 = Liquidation (red)
```

## Dynamic Interest Rates

### Base Rates vs Dynamic Adjustments

**Important**: Your normal interest rate is the weighted average from your collateral mix (as explained in "Weighted Debt Terms" above). Dynamic rate adjustments are an emergency mechanism that only activates during severe market stress — this is NOT the default state.

### When Dynamic Rates Activate

Ripe monitors the GREEN/USDC liquidity pool as a health indicator. Under normal conditions, you simply pay your weighted base rate. Dynamic adjustments only trigger when GREEN is under significant peg pressure.

**Key Point**: Dynamic rates are a protective mechanism that may never activate. They exist to incentivize market corrections during extreme conditions, not to penalize everyday borrowing.

**How Pool Monitoring Works:**
- **Balanced State**: 50% GREEN / 50% USDC → Base rates apply
- **Danger Zone**: GREEN exceeds 60% → Rate multipliers activate
- **Scaling Adjustments**: Rates increase proportionally from 60% to 100% GREEN

### Three-Layer Rate Adjustment

When imbalances occur, rates adjust through three mechanisms:

1. **Ratio-Based Multiplier**
   - Scales continuously based on pool composition
   - Higher GREEN percentage = Higher multiplier
   - Example: 65% GREEN might trigger a 1.5x multiplier, 80% GREEN a 2.5x multiplier

2. **Time-Based Accumulation**  
   - Additional increases for sustained imbalances
   - Typically 0.01% per 100 blocks in danger zone (~3.3 minutes on Base)
   - Creates urgency for market correction

3. **Maximum Rate Protection**
   - Hard caps prevent excessive rates
   - Protocol maximum (e.g., 50% APR)
   - Protects borrowers from extreme conditions

**Real Example:**
```
Your weighted base rate (from collateral mix): 5% APR
This is what you pay under normal conditions!

If pool reaches 70% GREEN for 5,000 blocks (~2.8 hours on Base):
- Your base rate: 5% (unchanged)
- Dynamic multiplier: 2.0x = 10% total
- Time boost: 0.01% × 50 = 0.5%
- Temporary rate: 10.5% APR

When pool returns to balance:
- Dynamic adjustments deactivate
- You return to paying just your 5% base rate
```

## Borrowing Limits and Safety

### Multi-Tiered Limit System

Ripe implements several limits to ensure sustainable growth:

**1. Collateral-Based Limits**
- Fundamental constraint based on deposited value
- Maximum = Sum of (Asset Value × LTV Ratio)

**2. Per-User Debt Ceiling**
- Individual caps during protocol growth phase
- Equal limits for all users
- Gradually increased by governance

**3. Global Debt Limit**
- System-wide GREEN supply cap
- Prevents unlimited minting
- Protects protocol stability

**4. Interval Borrowing Limits**
- Time-based windows (e.g., per 1,000 blocks = ~33 minutes on Base)
- Prevents flash loan attacks
- Smooths borrowing demand

**5. Minimum Debt Requirement**
- Starts at ~$10 during early protocol growth
- Will increase gradually as protocol scales
- Ensures position economic viability
- Reduces system complexity

When borrowing, the most restrictive limit applies. This creates a robust framework that protects both individual users and the protocol.

## The Borrowing Experience

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Deposit Collateral**: Add assets to Ripe vaults
2. **Calculate Capacity**: System determines your borrowing power
3. **Choose Amount**: Borrow up to your available limit
4. **Pay Origination Fee**: Small one-time fee (typically 0.5%)
5. **Choose How to Receive**: Option to receive as GREEN, auto-convert to sGREEN, or deposit directly into Stability Pool

### Distribution Options

When borrowing, you can choose one of three ways to receive your funds:

**Option 1: Direct GREEN** 
- Receive standard GREEN stablecoins
- Use immediately for any purpose
- Most flexible option

**Option 2: Auto-Convert to [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md)**
- Borrowed GREEN automatically wrapped into yield-bearing [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md)
- Start earning yield immediately on borrowed funds
- Potential for positive carry (yield > borrow rate)
- No separate conversion transaction needed

**Option 3: Direct to [Stability Pool](05-stability-pools.md)**
- Borrowed GREEN converted to sGREEN and deposited into [Stability Pool](05-stability-pools.md) in one transaction
- Earn both sGREEN yield AND stability pool rewards
- Participate in liquidations for discounted collateral
- Maximum yield potential but least liquid option

### Origination Fee (Daowry)

A one-time 0.5% fee on new borrows that:
- Flows directly to [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md) holders
- Creates immediate protocol revenue
- Aligns borrower and saver incentives

Example: Borrow 10,000 GREEN → Pay 50 GREEN fee → Receive 9,950 GREEN

## Repayment Flexibility

Ripe Protocol offers complete repayment flexibility:
- **No prepayment penalties** - Repay any amount at any time
- **No fixed terms** - Keep your loan as long as needed
- **Partial payments allowed** - Reduce debt incrementally
- **Instant debt reduction** - Payments immediately lower your risk

This flexibility lets you manage debt according to your needs without restrictive schedules or penalties.

# Savings GREEN (sGREEN): Your GREEN Working Harder

sGREEN transforms idle [GREEN stablecoins](01-green-stablecoin.md) into productive capital that automatically captures all protocol revenues. It's the simplest way to earn real yield in DeFi — no staking, no claiming, no complexity. Just deposit GREEN and watch your wealth grow through the power of compound interest.

## The sGREEN Advantage

### Automatic Wealth Accumulation

Unlike traditional staking where you must claim rewards, sGREEN operates on an elegant share-based system that compounds value automatically:

- **Set and Forget**: Your sGREEN balance stays constant while its GREEN value increases daily
- **No Gas Fees**: Value accrues through exchange rate appreciation, not token distributions
- **Compound Growth**: All revenues automatically reinvest, accelerating your returns
- **Capital Preservation**: The exchange rate can only increase — never decrease

**Real Example**: If you deposited 1,000 GREEN when the rate was 1.0 and it's now 1.08, your sGREEN is worth 1,080 GREEN — an 8% gain with zero effort.

### Where Your Yield Comes From

Every sGREEN holder benefits from multiple protocol revenue streams that flow directly to the vault:

1. **Borrower Interest Payments**: Continuous yield from all active loans across the protocol
2. **Origination Fees (Daowry)**: 0.5% fee on every new loan minted instantly adds value
3. **Unrealized Yield Flush**: Accrued interest from borrowers gets distributed to sGREEN holders
4. **Future Treasury Yields**: [Governance](08-governance.md) can direct [Endaoment](11-endaoment.md) profits to sGREEN holders

This isn't speculative yield — it's real revenue from actual protocol usage.

## Two Ways to Access sGREEN

### 1. Direct Deposit (Most Common)
Convert your GREEN to sGREEN with a simple deposit:
- Deposit any amount of GREEN to the vault
- Receive sGREEN shares at the current exchange rate
- Start earning immediately with no minimum or lock-up

**Example**: At a 1.1 rate, depositing 1,100 GREEN gives you 1,000 sGREEN

### 2. Smart Borrowing Strategy
Sophisticated users can borrow directly in sGREEN:
- Take out loans denominated in sGREEN instead of GREEN
- Your debt stays constant while your sGREEN grows
- Profit when sGREEN yield exceeds your borrow rate

**The Math**: Borrow at 5% APR, earn 8% on sGREEN = 3% net profit on borrowed funds

## Advanced Strategy: [Stability Pool](05-stability-pools.md)

Deposit sGREEN in [stability pools](05-stability-pools.md) to stack multiple revenue streams:

1. **Base Layer**: Continue earning sGREEN's native yield
2. **Liquidation Layer**: Purchase discounted collateral (typically 5-15% below market)
3. **Rewards Layer**: Earn RIPE tokens from the protocol's staker allocation
4. **Compounding Effect**: All three layers work together, multiplying returns

**Example Scenario**: 
- sGREEN base yield: 6% APR
- Liquidation profits: 8% APR
- [RIPE rewards](06-ripe-rewards.md): 4% APR
- **Total potential**: 18% APR (before compounding)

## Why sGREEN is Built Different

### Unbreakable Value Preservation
- **Monotonic Growth**: Exchange rate mathematically cannot decrease — only up or stable
- **Full Backing**: Every sGREEN always redeemable for its GREEN value
- **No Impairment Risk**: Protocol design prevents any value loss scenarios
- **Audited Security**: ERC-4626 standard implementation with comprehensive testing

### True DeFi Liquidity
- **Instant Redemption**: Convert to GREEN anytime with no delays
- **Zero Lock-ups**: Your capital is never trapped or restricted
- **No Exit Penalties**: Withdraw 100% of your value whenever needed
- **Full Transferability**: Send, trade, or use sGREEN anywhere ERC-20s are accepted

### Elegant Tax Efficiency
Unlike reward tokens that create taxable events, sGREEN's value accrues through price appreciation:
- No constant reward claiming
- Simplified accounting
- Potential tax advantages (consult your tax advisor)
- Clean transaction history

## Real User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Passive Saver
*Sarah deposits 10,000 GREEN into sGREEN and forgets about it for a year*
- Starting rate: 1.00 (10,000 sGREEN received)
- After 1 year at 7% APR: Rate is 1.07
- Sarah's value: 10,700 GREEN
- **Profit: 700 GREEN with zero actions taken**

### Scenario 2: The Yield Farmer
*Alex deposits 50,000 GREEN worth of sGREEN into stability pools*
- sGREEN base yield: 6% = 3,000 GREEN/year
- Liquidation profits: 8% = 4,000 GREEN/year
- RIPE rewards: 4% = 2,000 GREEN equivalent/year
- **Total return: 9,000 GREEN (18% APR) plus compounding**

### Scenario 3: The Arbitrageur
*Jordan borrows 100,000 GREEN as sGREEN at 5% APR*
- Borrowing cost: 5,000 GREEN/year
- sGREEN earnings at 8%: 8,000 GREEN/year
- **Net profit: 3,000 GREEN/year on borrowed capital**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does sGREEN compare to other yield-bearing stablecoins?**
A: sGREEN offers true decentralization, no lock-ups, and revenue from real protocol usage — not subsidized yields or risky strategies.

**Q: What drives sGREEN yields?**
A: Real borrowing demand. More loans = more interest and fees = higher sGREEN yields. It's sustainable because borrowers get productive capital.

**Q: Is there a minimum deposit?**
A: No minimums. Whether you have 10 GREEN or 10 million, you earn the same percentage yield.

**Q: Can sGREEN be used as collateral?**
A: Not currently within Ripe Protocol, but other DeFi protocols may accept it. Its appreciating nature makes it attractive collateral, potentially offering better terms than regular stablecoins.

**Q: What happens during market crashes?**
A: sGREEN remains stable. Market volatility often increases borrowing and liquidations, potentially boosting yields during turbulent times.

**Q: How often does the exchange rate update?**
A: Every transaction updates the rate in real-time. No waiting for daily rebase or epoch updates.

## The Bottom Line

sGREEN represents the evolution of stablecoin savings — combining the stability of GREEN with automatic yield generation that requires zero effort. Whether you're a passive holder seeking simple returns or an active strategist stacking yields, sGREEN provides the foundation for sustainable wealth accumulation in DeFi.

Your GREEN doesn't need to sit idle. Put it to work with sGREEN and let protocol revenues compound your wealth, automatically and perpetually.

# Stability Pools: Your Gateway to Liquidation Profits

Stability Pools are Ripe Protocol's first line of defense against bad debt and your opportunity to earn substantial returns by providing liquidity that absorbs liquidations. When borrowers' positions become undercollateralized, stability pool participants automatically purchase their collateral at discount — typically earning 5-15% instant profit while helping maintain protocol solvency.

## The Core Proposition

### Instant Arbitrage Opportunities

Unlike traditional liquidation systems that require active monitoring and complex bot infrastructure, stability pools democratize liquidation profits:

- **Passive Participation**: Deposit once and automatically participate in all liquidations
- **Fair Distribution**: Profits shared proportionally among all depositors
- **No Technical Barriers**: No bots, no gas wars, no timing games
- **Guaranteed Discounts**: Fixed liquidation fees ensure profitable swaps

When liquidations occur, your deposited assets instantly convert to discounted collateral — creating immediate, realized profit without any action on your part.

### Multiple Revenue Streams

Stability pool participants benefit from three distinct yield sources that compound together:

1. **Base Asset Yield**: [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md) continues earning protocol revenue while in the pool
2. **Liquidation Premiums**: Purchase collateral at 5-15% below market value
3. **[RIPE Rewards](06-ripe-rewards.md)**: Earn protocol tokens from the Stakers allocation

This triple-yield structure can generate returns significantly exceeding traditional DeFi strategies.

## How Stability Pools Work

### The Deposit Process

You can deposit two types of assets into stability pools:

**GREEN LP Tokens** (GREEN/USDC liquidity positions)
- Earn trading fees while waiting for liquidations
- First priority in liquidation hierarchy
- Transferred to [Endaoment](11-endaoment.md) treasury when used

**[sGREEN](04-sgreen.md)** (Savings GREEN)
- Continues earning base yield in the pool
- Used after GREEN LP tokens
- Redeemed and burned during liquidations

Your deposits are converted to shares representing your proportional claim on the pool's total value — including both deposited assets and accumulated liquidated collateral.

### The Liquidation Flow

When a borrower's position needs liquidation:

1. **Protocol checks stability pools** for available liquidity
2. **Your pool assets swap for collateral** at the liquidation discount
3. **You receive collateral worth more** than the assets spent
4. **The discount becomes your profit** — instantly realized

Example: If ETH is worth $2,000 and liquidation fee is 10%, the pool buys ETH at $1,800. You get $2,000 of ETH for $1,800 worth of pool assets — a $200 instant profit per ETH.

### USD Value-Based Accounting

Unlike simple token vaults, stability pools use sophisticated USD value-based share accounting:

- **Share Price = Total Pool Value / Total Shares**
- **Pool Value = Deposited Asset Value + All Claimable Asset Values**
- **Your Value = Your Shares × Current Share Price**

This ensures fair distribution regardless of which assets the pool holds at any moment.

## The Economics of Liquidation Profits

### How Liquidation Fees Become Your Profit

The protocol's liquidation fee structure directly determines your returns. When a position liquidates:

- **5% liquidation fee** = You buy collateral at 95% of market value
- **10% liquidation fee** = You buy collateral at 90% of market value
- **15% liquidation fee** = You buy collateral at 85% of market value

Higher-risk collateral types carry higher liquidation fees, meaning bigger profits for stability pool participants. The protocol calibrates these fees to ensure profitability even during volatile markets.

### Real-World Scenarios

**During Market Volatility**: Liquidations increase as prices swing, generating more profit opportunities. Your passive position captures value from market stress without active trading.

**In Stable Markets**: Fewer liquidations occur, but you continue earning base yields from sGREEN or GREEN LP tokens plus RIPE rewards. The triple-yield structure ensures returns even in quiet periods.

**Portfolio Effect**: As liquidations occur across different collateral types, you build a diversified basket of assets acquired at discount — essentially dollar-cost averaging into multiple positions at below-market prices.

## Advanced Features

### Claiming Liquidated Collateral

After liquidations, you can claim your proportional share of accumulated collateral:

- **Flexible Claims**: Choose which assets to claim and when
- **Value Preservation**: Your share value remains constant whether claimed or not
- **Auto-Deposit Option**: Claimed assets can automatically enter Ripe deposit vaults
- **Dynamic RIPE Rewards**: Claims trigger RIPE token rewards based on USD value claimed

#### Claim Incentives: Keeping Pools Healthy

The protocol uses a dynamic reward system to maintain optimal pool composition. When stability pools accumulate too much liquidated collateral, the protocol can activate claim incentives:

- **RIPE per Dollar Claimed**: Each asset can have a specific reward rate (e.g., 0.1 RIPE per $1 of ETH claimed)
- **Strategic Timing**: Higher rewards when pools need rebalancing with fresh sGREEN or GREEN LP
- **Automatic Distribution**: Rewards paid instantly when you claim, locked in [governance vault](08-governance.md)
- **Pool Health Mechanism**: Ensures pools always have liquidity for new liquidations

This creates a market-driven rebalancing system — when collateral accumulates, increased rewards incentivize claims, replenishing the pool with fresh deposits.

### GREEN Redemption Mechanism

Stability pools also serve as GREEN's price stability mechanism. When the pool holds liquidated collateral, any GREEN holder can:

1. **Redeem GREEN for collateral** at exactly $1 value
2. **Help stabilize GREEN price** through arbitrage
3. **Pool maintains value** as GREEN replaces claimed collateral

This creates a powerful peg defense mechanism while preserving depositor value.

#### How Redemptions Protect Your Deposits

When GREEN holders redeem for collateral, the GREEN they leave behind creates an unexpected benefit for depositors:

**Smart Liquidation Priority**: The protocol uses assets in a specific order during liquidations:
1. **Redeemed GREEN first** - Acts as a buffer, gets burned before touching your deposits
2. **GREEN LP tokens next** - Your liquidity positions, used only after GREEN is exhausted
3. **sGREEN last** - Your yield-bearing tokens, protected by the other layers

**The Protection Layer**: 
- Think of redeemed GREEN as a protective cushion for your deposits
- During busy redemption periods, this cushion grows larger
- Your yield-generating assets (GREEN LP and sGREEN) stay untouched longer
- More redemptions = more protection for depositors

This creates a beautiful synergy: the more people redeem GREEN for arbitrage profits, the more protected your deposited assets become during future liquidations. It's like having a self-replenishing shield that grows stronger with use.

### Multi-Asset Accumulation

Over time, stability pools accumulate diverse collateral types:

- ETH from liquidated Ethereum positions
- cbBTC from Bitcoin-backed loans  
- Various DeFi tokens from other collateral types
- GREEN from redemption operations

You maintain exposure to this diversified basket while earning on all components.

## Why Participate in Stability Pools?

### For Yield Seekers
- **Triple-stacked returns** from base yield, liquidations, and rewards
- **Passive income** requiring no active management

# RIPE Block Rewards: Earning While You Participate

RIPE block rewards are the heartbeat of Ripe Protocol's incentive system — continuously distributing tokens to users who actively strengthen the ecosystem. Whether you're [borrowing GREEN](03-borrowing.md), providing liquidity, or simply holding assets, the protocol rewards your participation with a share of 150 million RIPE tokens (15% of total supply) allocated specifically for community incentives.

> **📊 Rewards at a Glance**
> - **Total RIPE for rewards**: 150M (15% of supply)
> - **Target daily emissions**: ~4,320,000 RIPE (when fully ramped on Base)
> - **Current emissions**: Starting at 0.0025 RIPE/block (ramping up)
> - **Best earning strategy**: GREEN LP (65% of staker rewards)
> - **Current split**: 90% to stakers, 10% to borrowers
> - **Auto-stake requirement**: 75% of claimed rewards locked for 1 year
> - **Claim anytime**: No minimum, no lockup for earning

## Quick Start: Understanding Your Rewards

**🎯 The One-Minute Version:**

```
YOUR ACTIVITY          →  REWARD POOL  →  YOUR SHARE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Staking RIPE/sGREEN    →  90% of RIPE  →  Based on stake + lock bonus
Borrowing GREEN        →  10% of RIPE  →  Based on debt size

FUTURE ALLOCATIONS (Not Active Yet):
Depositing any asset   →  TBD % of RIPE  →  Based on USD value
Future voted assets    →  TBD % of RIPE  →  Community decides

SIMPLE FORMULA: Your % of pool × Pool rewards = Your RIPE
```

**💡 Key Insight**: You don't compete with all users — only those in your specific pool. A borrower doesn't dilute a staker's rewards!

## The Reward Engine

### Continuous Token Flow

Unlike traditional yield farming with discrete epochs, Ripe's rewards flow continuously:

- **Every Block Counts**: New RIPE tokens mint with each blockchain block
- **Real-Time Accumulation**: Your rewards grow second by second, not weekly or monthly
- **No Waiting Periods**: Start earning immediately upon participation
- **Fair Distribution**: Time-weighted system prevents gaming or manipulation

### The Points System

Ripe uses an elegant points mechanism that rewards both size and commitment:

```
Points = Position Size × Time Held (in blocks)
```

This simple formula creates profound fairness — a smaller position held longer can earn more than a whale's brief deposit. It's democracy through mathematics.

### Emission Schedule Ramp-Up

**Important Context**: The protocol is currently in its emission ramp-up phase:

- **Starting emissions**: 0.0025 RIPE per block (~108 RIPE per day on Base)
- **Target emissions**: ~100 RIPE per block (~4,320,000 RIPE per day on Base)
- **Ramp-up period**: Gradual increase to match 5-year distribution schedule
- **Why this matters**: Current rewards are ~40,000x lower than examples shown

This conservative start ensures:
1. **Sustainable token distribution** over the full 5-year period
2. **Time for liquidity to build** before major emissions
3. **Gradual market absorption** of new RIPE tokens
4. **Protection against early dumping** when liquidity is thin

**Note**: All reward calculations in this document assume target emission rates for illustration. Multiply by current emission rate (0.0025/100 = 0.0025%) for actual current rewards.

## Current Reward Categories

The protocol currently distributes rewards to two participant groups:

### 1. Stakers (90% of Emissions) 💎

Staking in protocol vaults earns the lion's share of rewards:

**[Governance Vault](08-governance.md) (RIPE & RIPE LP)**
- **Base Rewards**: Size × time × asset weight
- **Lock Multiplier**: Up to 3x boost for maximum duration locks
- **LP Advantage**: RIPE LP tokens earn 50% more points than RIPE
- **Compound Strategy**: Auto-stake rewards for exponential growth

**[Stability Pools](05-stability-pools.md) ([sGREEN](04-sgreen.md) & GREEN LP)**
- **Dual Yield**: RIPE rewards plus liquidation profits
- **No Lock Required**: Flexible liquidity with full rewards
- **Risk Buffer**: Help secure the protocol while earning

### 2. Borrowers (10% of Emissions) 💰

Taking out GREEN loans earns rewards proportional to your debt:

- **Reward Basis**: Outstanding GREEN principal × time borrowed
- **Why It Matters**: Borrowing creates GREEN demand and protocol revenue
- **Smart Strategy**: Larger, longer-term loans maximize rewards
- **Real Benefit**: Offset borrowing costs with RIPE earnings

## Future Reward Categories (Not Active Yet)

### Vote Depositors (Future)

When governance activates, token holders may vote to allocate rewards to specific assets:

- **Democratic Selection**: Community chooses reward-earning assets
- **Targeted Incentives**: Direct liquidity where protocol needs it most
- **Strategic Deposits**: Align your holdings with governance decisions

### General Depositors (Future)

May be activated to reward all vault deposits:

- **USD-Weighted**: Fair distribution based on deposit value
- **Asset Agnostic**: All supported assets participate equally
- **Passive Income**: Earn just by holding assets in Ripe vaults

## Understanding Your Share

### Asset-Specific Allocations

Each supported asset has its own configuration that determines how it splits the top-level reward pools:

- **Staker Points Allocation**: Percentage of the total Stakers pool this asset receives
  - Only applies to staked assets (RIPE, RIPE LP in [Governance Vault](08-governance.md); [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md), GREEN LP in [Stability Pools](05-stability-pools.md))
  - Current allocations:
    - GREEN LP: 65% (highest rewards!)
    - RIPE LP: 15%
    - sGREEN: 10%
    - RIPE: 10%
  
- **Voter Points Allocation**: Percentage of the Vote Depositors pool this asset receives
  - Only for assets selected through governance voting
  - All voter allocations across eligible assets must sum to 100%
  - Staked assets have 0% voter allocation since they earn from the Stakers pool

**Important**: These percentages split their respective category pools. If Vote Depositors receive 20% of total emissions and Asset A has 50% voter allocation, Asset A depositors share 10% of total emissions (50% of 20%).

### How Rewards Actually Flow (Simplified)

Think of RIPE rewards like a waterfall with two splits:

```
Total RIPE Emissions (100 RIPE/block)
            ↓
    ┌───────┴───────┐
    │ First Split  │ (by user type)
    └───────┬───────┘
            ↓
    90% → Stakers Pool
    10% → Borrowers Pool  
    
    Future: Vote & General Pools
    (Currently 0%, may change)
            ↓
    ┌───────┴───────┐
    │ Second Split │ (by asset within pool)
    └───────┬───────┘
            ↓
    Each asset gets its
    configured percentage
            ↓
    Your share based on
    your points vs total

```

### Step-by-Step Calculation Guide

Let's follow your RIPE rewards step by step:

**🎯 Step 1: Where Do Your Rewards Come From?**
```
If you're staking RIPE → You earn from the Stakers pool (90%)
If you're borrowing → You earn from the Borrowers pool (10%)
Future: General deposits and voted assets (not active yet)
```

**🎯 Step 2: What's Your Asset's Share?**
```
Within the Stakers pool (90 RIPE/block):
- GREEN LP tokens get 65% (largest share!)
- RIPE LP tokens get 15%
- sGREEN gets 10%
- RIPE tokens get 10%

So stakers share 90 RIPE/block:
- GREEN LP stakers: 90 × 65% = 58.5 RIPE
- RIPE LP stakers: 90 × 15% = 13.5 RIPE
- sGREEN holders: 90 × 10% = 9 RIPE
- RIPE stakers: 90 × 10% = 9 RIPE
```

**🎯 Step 3: What's YOUR Share of Your Asset Pool?**
```
Your Points = Amount × Time
Your Share = Your Points ÷ Total Points for that asset

Example: You stake 1,000 RIPE for 100 blocks
- Your points: 1,000 × 100 = 100,000
- Total RIPE points: 1,000,000
- Your share: 100,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = 10%
```

**🎯 Step 4: Calculate Your Rewards**
```
Your rewards = Your share × Asset's allocation

From above: 10% × 9 RIPE = 0.9 RIPE per block
Over 100 blocks: 0.9 × 100 = 90 RIPE earned!
```

### Quick Reference Table

| Your Action | Pool You Earn From | How to Maximize |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Provide GREEN LP | Stakers (90%) - 65% share | Larger positions earn more |
| Provide RIPE LP | Stakers (90%) - 15% share | Larger positions earn more |
| Stake RIPE | Stakers (90%) - 10% share | Lock for 3 years (+200% bonus) |
| Deposit sGREEN | Stakers (90%) - 10% share | Combine with stability pool benefits |
| Borrow GREEN | Borrowers (10%) | Larger, longer loans |
| Future: General deposits | Not active yet | TBD |
| Future: Voted assets | Not active yet | TBD |

### Simple Rewards Estimator

**"How much will I earn?"** - Quick formulas for common scenarios:

⚠️ **Note**: Examples below use TARGET emission rates (100 RIPE/block). Current emissions are 0.0025 RIPE/block, so multiply results by 0.0025% for actual current rewards.

**For GREEN LP (Highest Rewards - 65% of stakers):**
```
Daily Rewards ≈ (Your LP Value / Total GREEN LP) × 2,527,200

Example: $100,000 in GREEN LP (1% of total)
= 1% × 2,527,200 = ~25,272 RIPE per day
= ~$2,527.20 per day (at $0.10 RIPE)
= ~92.2% APR in USD terms
```

**For RIPE Staking (10% of stakers):**
```
Daily Rewards ≈ (Your RIPE / Total RIPE Staked) × 388,800 × Lock Multiplier

Example: 10,000 RIPE staked (1% of total) with 1-year lock
= 1% × 388,800 × 1.5 = ~5,832 RIPE per day
= ~$583.20 per day (at $0.10 RIPE)
= Your stake worth $1,000, earning $583.20/day = 21,287% APR
```

**For sGREEN Deposits (10% of stakers):**
```
Daily Rewards ≈ (Your sGREEN Value / Total sGREEN) × 388,800

Example: $20,000 in sGREEN (2% of total)
= 2% × 388,800 = ~7,776 RIPE per day
= ~$777.60 per day (at $0.10 RIPE)
= ~1,418% APR in USD terms
```

**For Borrowing GREEN (10% of emissions):**
```
Daily Rewards ≈ (Your Debt / Total Debt) × 432,000

Example: $50,000 borrowed (0.5% of total debt)
= 0.5% × 432,000 = ~2,160 RIPE per day
= ~$216.00 per day (at $0.10 RIPE)
= ~158% APR in rewards (offsetting borrowing costs!)
```

## Auto-Staking Mechanism

### How Auto-Staking Works

The protocol enforces auto-staking to balance token distribution with long-term alignment:

- **Stake Ratio**: 75% must be auto-staked
  - Only 25% goes to your wallet as liquid RIPE
  - Prevents market flooding while building committed participants
  
- **Duration Ratio**: 33% × 3-year max = 1-year lock
  - All auto-staked rewards are locked for 1 year
  - Ensures reward recipients become long-term stakeholders
  
**Why This Matters**: Rather than dumping tokens on the market, auto-staking creates a community of invested participants who earn governance power alongside their rewards. You're not just earning tokens — you're earning a voice in the protocol's future.

## Protocol Configuration

### Flexible Parameters

Mission Control governs all reward settings:

- **Emission Rate**: RIPE tokens minted per block
- **Category Splits**: Percentage to each participant type
- **Asset Allocations**: Individual asset point multipliers
- **Auto-Stake Settings**: Default ratios and durations

### Governance Evolution

Once activated, RIPE holders will control:
- Emission schedules and rates
- Category allocation adjustments
- Asset-specific incentives
- New reward mechanisms

## Common Questions About Rewards

### "Why do I calculate my share twice?"

You don't! Think of it as one calculation with two inputs:
1. **Which pie you're eating from** (Staker, Borrower, etc.)
2. **How big your slice is** (Your percentage of that pie)

It's like a buffet where desserts are on one table and mains on another — you only compete with people at your table, not the whole restaurant!

### "How do I estimate my rewards?"

**Simple Method:**
1. Find your pool's daily RIPE allocation (at target emissions):
   - Stakers total: 3,888,000 RIPE/day (90% of emissions)
   - Borrowers total: 432,000 RIPE/day (10% of emissions)
2. For stakers, find your asset's share:
   - GREEN LP: 2,527,200 RIPE/day (65% of stakers)
   - RIPE LP: 583,200 RIPE/day (15% of stakers)
   - sGREEN: 388,800 RIPE/day (10% of stakers)
   - RIPE: 388,800 RIPE/day (10% of stakers)
3. Multiply: asset allocation × your percentage = daily rewards

**Example**: You have 1% of all staked RIPE → 388,800 × 1% = 3,888 RIPE per day

### "What happens when I claim?"

The protocol enforces auto-staking parameters to align incentives:

**Current Settings (Protocol-Controlled):**
- **Auto-stake percentage**: 75% must be auto-staked
- **Lock duration**: 1 year (33% of max 3-year duration)
- **Your choice**: Only whether to claim now or wait

**Example Claim:**
- You have 1,000 RIPE rewards to claim
- Protocol requires 75% auto-stake with 1-year lock
- Result: 250 RIPE to your wallet + 750 RIPE locked in governance vault

**Why This Matters**: Auto-staking prevents market flooding and ensures reward recipients become long-term stakeholders with governance power. You're earning both tokens AND future influence!

### "Do different assets in the same pool compete?"

Yes, within each pool! For example, in the Stakers pool:
- RIPE stakers compete with other RIPE stakers
- RIPE LP stakers compete with other RIPE LP stakers
- But they share the total Stakers allocation based on configured percentages

### "What happens if nobody stakes/borrows?"

More rewards for those who do! If you're the only RIPE staker, you get 100% of RIPE's allocation in the Stakers pool. Early participants often see highest returns.

# Liquidations: A Multi-Layered Defense System

Ripe Protocol's liquidation system represents a sophisticated approach to managing undercollateralized positions. Rather than harsh, immediate liquidations that can devastate borrowers, Ripe employs a graduated system designed to protect both users and the protocol. Multiple lines of defense work together to maintain GREEN's stability while giving borrowers every opportunity to recover.

## Executive Summary

**Key Points:**
- 🛡️ **Three defense layers**: Redemption buffer → Stability pools → Dutch auctions
- 📊 **Partial only**: Liquidates just enough to restore health, not entire position
- 💰 **Fair pricing**: 5-15% liquidation fees, much lower than competitors
- ⚡ **Automated**: Keeper network ensures rapid execution
- 🎯 **Your assets first**: Burns your GREEN/sGREEN before touching other collateral

## Why Liquidations Matter

### Protecting Protocol Solvency

Liquidations serve as the critical mechanism ensuring that [GREEN](01-green-stablecoin.md) remains fully backed. When [borrowing positions](03-borrowing.md) become undercollateralized due to collateral value drops or accumulated interest, the protocol must act to prevent bad debt accumulation. Without effective liquidations, the protocol could become insolvent, threatening all participants.

### The Borrower-Friendly Approach

Unlike traditional DeFi protocols that liquidate entire positions at once, Ripe only liquidates the minimum necessary to restore healthy collateralization. This approach:

- **Preserves User Value**: Keep as much collateral as possible
- **Reduces Market Impact**: Smaller liquidations mean less selling pressure
- **Enables Recovery**: Partial liquidations allow positions to potentially recover
- **Maintains Fairness**: Fixed fees rather than arbitrary penalties

## Understanding the Risk Zones

### The Three Critical Thresholds

Your position's safety depends on three key thresholds that work together to create graduated risk zones:

**1. Maximum LTV (Loan-to-Value)**
- Your borrowing limit as a percentage of collateral
- Example: 70% LTV on $10,000 = $7,000 maximum borrow
- Cannot borrow more once reached

**2. Redemption Threshold**
- Early warning system before liquidation
- GREEN holders can redeem against your position
- Provides market-based deleveraging opportunity
- Example: At 80% threshold, others can swap GREEN for your collateral at par

**3. Liquidation Threshold**
- The danger zone where forced liquidation begins
- Calculated as minimum collateral needed for your debt
- Example: At 90% threshold with $8,000 debt, liquidation starts when collateral < $8,889

### How Risk Escalates: Visual Zone Map

Consider a position with $10,000 initial collateral and $6,000 debt:

```
POSITION HEALTH VISUALIZATION (for $6,000 debt)
←─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────→
$10,000                    $8,571      $7,500     $6,667      $0

[════ SAFE ZONE ════][CAUTION][REDEMPTION][LIQUIDATION]
     ✅ Healthy        ⚠️ Warning  🚨 Danger    💀 Critical
```

**Zone Breakdown:**

**🟢 Zone 1: Healthy** (Collateral > $8,571)
- Below 70% LTV maximum
- Can still borrow more
- No intervention possible

**🟡 Zone 2: Warning** (Collateral $8,571 - $7,500)
- Exceeded max LTV, cannot borrow
- Still safe from redemption
- Time to add collateral or repay

**🟠 Zone 3: Redemption** (Collateral $7,500 - $6,667)
- Redemption threshold breached
- GREEN holders can redeem your collateral
- Acts as automatic deleveraging

**🔴 Zone 4: Liquidation** (Collateral < $6,667)
- Liquidation threshold breached
- Multi-phase liquidation activates
- Position being actively liquidated

*For a detailed explanation of how these thresholds work together, see [Understanding Three Thresholds](03-borrowing.md#how-thresholds-work-together-a-visual-guide) in the borrowing documentation.*

## The Redemption Buffer

### Your First Line of Defense

Before liquidation becomes possible, the redemption mechanism provides a unique protective buffer. When your position enters the redemption zone:

- **GREEN holders can exchange** their tokens for your collateral at exactly $1 value
- **No discount applied** - fair value exchange protects you from penalties
- **Reduces your debt** automatically as collateral is redeemed
- **May prevent liquidation** by improving your position health

This mechanism serves dual purposes: protecting borrowers through gradual deleveraging while helping maintain GREEN's $1 peg during market stress.

### How Redemptions Help Everyone

When GREEN trades below $1:
- Arbitrageurs buy cheap GREEN from markets
- Redeem it against positions for $1 of collateral
- Creates buying pressure that restores the peg
- Provides liquidity exactly when needed most

## The Three-Phase Liquidation Process

When liquidation becomes necessary, Ripe employs a carefully orchestrated three-phase approach designed to minimize impact while ensuring debt repayment.

### Phase 1: Using Your Own Assets First

The protocol first looks to your existing positions within Ripe:

**GREEN and [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md) Burning**
- If you hold GREEN or [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md) in stability pools
- These are burned first to repay your debt
- Most direct form of repayment
- No market impact or external sales

**Stablecoin Transfers**
- Other stablecoins (USDC, USDT) you've deposited
- Transferred to [Endaoment](11-endaoment.md) treasury
- Used to back protocol reserves
- Counts toward debt repayment

### Phase 2: Stability Pool Swaps

Next, the protocol engages [stability pools](05-stability-pools.md) for instant liquidity:

**How Pool Swaps Work**
1. Your collateral (ETH, WBTC, etc.) needs liquidation
2. [Stability pools](05-stability-pools.md) hold GREEN LP tokens and [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md)
3. Pool assets swap for your collateral at the liquidation discount
4. Pool participants get discounted assets, you avoid market dumps

**Special Note on Permissioned Assets**
For regulated assets (tokenized securities, real estate):
- Dedicated permissioned pools with whitelisted participants
- Same swap mechanics but restricted access
- Ensures compliance throughout liquidation process

**The Win-Win Dynamic**
- You avoid harsh market conditions and slippage
- Pool depositors earn fixed discounts (typically 5-15%)
- Protocol maintains orderly liquidations
- No dependence on external market depth

**Additional Pool Benefits**
- Depositors earn RIPE rewards from the Stakers allocation
- GREEN holders can redeem against pool collateral for peg stability
- Flexible withdrawal lets depositors choose which assets to claim

*For deeper understanding of stability pool mechanics, see [Stability Pools](05-stability-pools.md).*

### Phase 3: Dutch Auctions

For any remaining collateral after pools are exhausted:

**Time-Based Discounts**
- Auctions start with small discounts (e.g., 2%)
- Discounts increase linearly over time (up to 20%)
- Anyone with GREEN can buy instantly at current discount
- No waiting for auction to "end" - immediate settlement

**Auction Mechanics**
- Initial delay prevents front-running
- Buyers can purchase any amount of fungible assets
- GREEN payment is burned, reducing your debt
- Auction ends when all collateral sold or debt repaid
- Any excess collateral value returns to you

## Liquidation Economics

### Understanding Liquidation Fees

Liquidation fees serve multiple purposes in the ecosystem:

**Fee Structure**
- Base liquidation fee: Typically 5-15% depending on asset risk
- Keeper rewards: Small additional fee (0.1-0.5%) for liquidation executors
- Total impact: Your cost becomes others' profit opportunity

**Where Fees Go**
1. **Stability Pool Depositors**: Receive discounted collateral as compensation
2. **Keepers**: Earn rewards for monitoring and executing liquidations
3. **Auction Buyers**: Purchase collateral below market value
4. **Protocol**: No direct protocol extraction - all value flows to participants

### Partial Liquidation Design

Ripe's system only liquidates enough to restore healthy LTV:

**Target Calculation**
- Determines minimum repayment for safe LTV
- Adds small buffer (1-2%) for safety
- Preserves maximum collateral possible
- Single formula works across all liquidation types

> **💡 TL;DR**: If you're at 80% LTV and need to get back to 50%, we only liquidate exactly what's needed - not your entire position. In the example below, you keep 25% of your collateral instead of losing everything.

**Example Partial Liquidation**
```
Starting position: 
- Debt: $1,000
- Collateral: $1,250 (LTV = 80% - at liquidation threshold!)
- Max allowed LTV: 50%
- Liquidation fee: 10%

Protocol's unified formula: R = (D - T×C) × (1-F) / (1 - F - T)
Where: D = debt, C = collateral, T = target LTV, F = fee ratio

Calculation:
- R = ($1,000 - 0.50×$1,250) × 0.90 / (1 - 0.10 - 0.50)
- R = ($1,000 - $625) × 0.90 / 0.40
- R = $375 × 0.90 / 0.40
- R = $843.75 (amount to repay)

What happens:
1. Need to liquidate $937.50 of collateral (to get $843.75 after 10% fee)
2. Stability pools pay $843.75 (they keep 10% discount = $93.75)
3. Your debt reduces by $843.75

Final position:
- Debt: $1,000 - $843.75 = $156.25
- Collateral: $1,250 - $937.50 = $312.50
- New LTV: $156.25 ÷ $312.50 = 50% exactly!

Success! The unified formula perfectly calculates the liquidation amount
to achieve target LTV, while you keep 25% of your original collateral.
```

> **🎯 Simple Version**: Started with $1,250 collateral → Lost $937.50 to liquidation → Kept $312.50 (25%). Compare this to other protocols that would liquidate your entire $1,250!

## The Keeper Network

### Your Automated Safety Net

Keepers are the protocol's decentralized guardians — independent operators who monitor positions and execute liquidations when needed. Think of them as automated lifeguards watching over the protocol.

**How Keepers Work**
- Monitor all positions 24/7 for liquidation thresholds
- Trigger liquidations the moment positions become unsafe
- Earn small rewards (typically 0.1-0.5% of debt) for their service
- Compete to execute liquidations quickly and efficiently

**Why This Benefits You**
- **Faster Response**: Liquidations happen within blocks, not hours
- **Fair Execution**: Open competition prevents insider advantages
- **Lower Losses**: Quick action minimizes how underwater positions get
- **Always Active**: Global network ensures 24/7 coverage

Anyone can be a keeper — no special permissions needed. This open system ensures liquidations happen promptly and fairly, protecting both borrowers and the protocol.

4. **Rapid Execution**: Automated systems respond instantly
5. **Proven Resilience**: Designed for extreme market conditions

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Flash Crash with Redemption Buffer
*ETH drops from $2,500 to $1,800 in minutes*

**Your Position:**
- Collateral: 10 ETH (was $25,000, now $18,000)
- Debt: $15,000 GREEN
- LTV jumps: 60% → 83%

**What Happens:**
- At 80% you hit redemption threshold (not liquidation yet!)
- Arbitrageurs buy cheap GREEN and redeem $3,000 against your position
- Your debt drops to $12,000, LTV improves to 67%
- ETH rebounds to $2,100 within hours
- **Result**: Position saved by redemption buffer, no liquidation triggered

**Key Insight**: The redemption mechanism bought you time during extreme volatility.

### Scenario 2: Interest Accumulation Triggers Liquidation
*Forgot about your position for 6 months*

**Your Position Evolution:**
- Collateral: $62,500 ETH + $3,000 USDC = $65,500 total
- Max borrowing power: (ETH × 70%) + (USDC × 90%) = $43,750 + $2,700 = $46,450
- Debt: $46,000 (99% of max borrowing power - risky!)
- Month 3: $46,920 debt from 8% APR interest (exceeds borrowing power)
- Month 6: $47,840 debt (position underwater - liquidation triggered!)
- Also have: 2,000 sGREEN in stability pool (not collateral)

**Liquidation Execution:**
1. **Phase 1**: Burns your 2,000 sGREEN → debt drops to $45,840
2. **Phase 1**: Transfers 3,000 USDC to Endaoment → debt drops to $42,840
3. **Phase 2**: Need to restore position to safe borrowing capacity
   - Current: $42,840 debt, $62,500 ETH collateral only
   - ETH max borrowing: $62,500 × 70% = $43,750
   - Already under max! But need buffer for safety
   - Target: reduce debt to $40,000 (64% of ETH value)
   - Using unified formula with modest liquidation:
   - Liquidate $3,155 ETH at 10% fee → receive $2,840 GREEN
   - Your debt: $42,840 - $2,840 = $40,000
   - Your collateral: $62,500 - $3,155 = $59,345 ETH
   - New borrowing capacity: $59,345 × 70% = $41,541 (debt is $40,000 ✓)

**Final Damage:**
- Lost $315 to liquidation discount ($3,155 × 10%)
- Plus lost all your USDC collateral ($3,000)
- Total loss: $3,315 vs paying $1,840 interest
- **Key Insight**: Interest slowly pushes you toward liquidation - monitor regularly!

### Scenario 3: Multi-Collateral Liquidation
*You have diverse collateral when liquidation hits*

**Your Position:**
- 5,000 sGREEN in stability pool ($5,250 value - 0% LTV, not counted as collateral)
- 10,000 USDC (90% LTV)
- 3 ETH ($6,000, 70% LTV)
- Max borrowing power: ($10,000 × 90%) + ($6,000 × 70%) = $9,000 + $4,200 = $13,200
- Debt: $13,000 (98.5% of max - liquidation triggered!)
- Assets total: $21,250 (but only $16,000 counts as collateral)

**Important Note:** sGREEN and GREEN LP tokens have 0% LTV - they cannot be used as collateral for borrowing. Your actual borrowing capacity comes only from USDC and ETH.

**Liquidation Sequence:**
1. **Phase 1**: Burns your 5,000 sGREEN → debt drops to $7,750
2. **Phase 1**: Transfers 7,000 USDC to Endaoment → debt drops to $750
3. **Phase 2**: Swaps 0.42 ETH with stability pools → debt cleared
   - Need $833 of ETH to get $750 after 10% fee
   - You keep: 3,000 USDC + 2.58 ETH
4. **Final Position**: Debt cleared, borrowing capacity restored
   - Remaining: 3,000 USDC + 2.58 ETH = $8,160 collateral value
   - Max borrowing: ($3,000 × 90%) + ($5,160 × 70%) = $6,312

**Key Insight**: Your sGREEN holdings, while not collateral, serve as your first line of defense in liquidation - protecting your actual collateral assets.

### Scenario 4: Worst Case - High Fee Asset
*Your experimental token position goes bad*

**Your Position:**
- Collateral: $10,000 in volatile gaming token
- Debt: $5,000 (50% LTV)
- Token drops 30% → collateral now $7,000
- LTV jumps to 71%, triggering liquidation
- Liquidation fee: 15% (high-risk asset)

**What Happens:**
- No stability pools for this asset - straight to auction
- Current position: $5,000 debt / $7,000 collateral = 71.4% LTV
- Using unified formula to reach 50% LTV: R = (D - T×C) × (1-F) / (1 - F - T)
- R = ($5,000 - 0.50×$7,000) × 0.85 / (0.85 - 0.50)
- R = $1,500 × 0.85 / 0.35 = $3,643 repayment needed
- Collateral to liquidate (includes 15% fee): $3,643 / 0.85 = $4,286
- Dutch auction: buyers pay $3,643 GREEN for $4,286 of collateral
- Auction discount at purchase: 12% (buyers pay 88% of value)
- Actual GREEN paid: $3,643 × 0.88 = $3,206
- **Result**: Debt reduced by $3,206 to $1,794
- **Your collateral**: $7,000 - $4,286 = $2,714
- **New LTV**: $1,794 ÷ $2,714 = 66% (not quite at target due to auction discount)

**Key Insight**: Auction discounts mean you don't get full debt reduction. Lost $1,080 total ($643 liq fee + $437 auction discount).

## What If Bad Debt Occurs?

Despite all protective mechanisms, extreme market conditions could potentially create bad debt (where liquidation proceeds don't fully cover the debt). The protocol has a clear resolution mechanism:

**Bond Sales for Recovery**: The protocol can sell [bonds](10-bonds.md) to raise funds that clear bad debt. This process:
- Creates RIPE tokens beyond the 1 billion supply cap
- Distributes the dilution fairly across all RIPE holders
- Ensures bond buyers receive their full allocation
- Maintains protocol solvency without penalizing users

For example, if 1M RIPE is needed to cover bad debt, the total supply becomes 1.001 billion. This transparent mechanism ensures the protocol can always recover while treating all participants fairly.

## The Bottom Line

Ripe Protocol's liquidation system represents a fundamental rethinking of how DeFi handles risk. By prioritizing borrower protection while maintaining protocol solvency, the system creates sustainable conditions for all participants. The multi-phase approach, redemption buffer, and partial liquidation design work together to give you every opportunity to maintain your position while ensuring GREEN remains fully backed.

Understanding these mechanisms empowers you to borrow with confidence, knowing that the protocol's design aligns with your interests even in worst-case scenarios.

# Ripe Governance: Power Through Commitment

The Ripe Governance Vault transforms RIPE tokens into voting power through a unique time-locked staking system. By committing tokens for extended periods, participants earn governance points that will control every aspect of the protocol — from asset parameters to treasury strategies. While full on-chain governance hasn't launched yet, **your governance power is actively accumulating now**, positioning early participants to shape Ripe Protocol's future.

## Why Lock RIPE?

### The Power of Time Commitment

Traditional governance systems treat all tokens equally, allowing whales to buy influence at the last minute. Ripe's approach rewards genuine long-term believers:

- **Time-Weighted Power**: Governance points accumulate continuously based on both stake size and duration
- **Lock Bonuses**: Longer commitments earn exponentially more voting power (up to 3x for maximum locks)
- **Early Advantage**: Points earned today compound over time, giving early participants outsized influence
- **Aligned Incentives**: Those willing to lock tokens longest have the most say in protocol direction

### Real Yield Through Staking

Beyond governance power, RIPE stakers earn substantial rewards:

- **[Block Rewards](06-ripe-rewards.md)**: Governance vault participants earn rewards from the staker allocation
- **Enhanced LP Rewards**: RIPE LP tokens earn 50% more points than regular RIPE
- **Auto-Compounding**: Claim rewards directly into the vault for exponential growth
- **No Opportunity Cost**: Earn while building governance influence

## How Governance Points Work

### The Point Accumulation Engine

Your governance power grows through a sophisticated point system that rewards both commitment and patience:

```
Base Points = Deposited Tokens × Blocks Held × Asset Weight
Lock Bonus = Base Points × Lock Bonus Multiplier
Total Points = Base Points + Lock Bonus
```

**Key Mechanics:**
- Points accumulate every block (not just at intervals)
- Longer locks multiply your earning rate
- LP tokens receive 1.5x weight for providing liquidity
- Points compound — early deposits gain massive advantages

### Lock Duration Rewards

The vault offers dramatic bonuses for longer commitments:

| Lock Duration | Bonus Multiplier | Effective APY Boost |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1 day (minimum) | 0% | 1x points |
| 3 months | ~15% | 1.15x points |
| 6 months | ~35% | 1.35x points |
| 1 year | ~65% | 1.65x points |
| 2 years | ~130% | 2.3x points |
| 3 years (maximum) | 200% | 3x points |

**Example**: Lock 1,000 RIPE for 2 years and earn 2.3x the governance points of someone who locks for just 1 day.

### Asset Weighting System

Not all deposits are created equal:

- **RIPE Tokens**: 100% weight (baseline)
- **RIPE LP Tokens**: 150% weight (50% bonus for liquidity provision)

This incentivizes users to provide liquidity while building governance power, strengthening the entire ecosystem.

## Managing Your Position

### Making Deposits

**Standard Path** (through protocol UI):
- Deposits automatically use minimum lock duration
- Points begin accumulating immediately
- Can extend lock anytime for bonus multiplier

**Advanced Path** (for protocols/contracts):
- Specify custom lock durations up to 3 years
- Used for treasury management and reward distribution
- Weighted averaging with existing positions

### Lock Extensions: Your Power Move

Extending locks is the ultimate governance strategy:
- **Instant Bonus**: Lock bonus recalculates immediately on extension
- **No Downside**: Can only extend, never reduce lock time
- **Compound Strategy**: Extend when claiming rewards for maximum effect
- **Flexibility**: Extend partially through lock period to optimize

**Pro Tip**: Time your extensions with reward claims to maximize compounding.

### Early Exit: The Nuclear Option

Need liquidity urgently? Early exit is possible but extremely costly:

- **80% Penalty**: Forfeit 80% of your deposited tokens
- **Complete Point Loss**: ALL governance points vanish instantly
- **Permanent**: Cannot recover forfeited tokens or points
- **Smart Protection**: System prevents exits during bad debt (when you couldn't withdraw anyway)

**The Math**: Exit with 10,000 RIPE locked → Receive only 2,000 RIPE back

This severe penalty ensures only genuine emergencies trigger early exits, protecting the governance system's integrity.

### Natural Unlock: Patience Rewards

When your lock expires:
- **Full Access**: Withdraw 100% of tokens with no penalty
- **Continued Earning**: Points keep accumulating at base rate
- **Re-lock Option**: Establish new lock for bonus multiplier
- **Flexible Timing**: No rush — unlocked tokens remain productive

## Stacking Rewards: The Triple Play

RIPE governance participants benefit from three distinct reward streams:

### 1. Governance Points (Future Voting Power)
- Accumulate continuously based on stake and time
- Lock bonuses multiply accumulation rate
- Compound through extended commitments
- Translate directly to voting weight when governance launches

### 2. [RIPE Block Rewards](06-ripe-rewards.md) (Staker Allocation)
- Governance vault receives rewards from the staker emission category
- Distribution based on share of total staked RIPE/LP
- Auto-stake option compounds returns
- No additional action required — just hold

### 3. Strategic Positioning
- Early participants gain disproportionate influence
- Time advantage compounds exponentially
- First movers shape initial parameters
- Network effects benefit early believers

## What You'll Control (Coming Soon)

When on-chain governance activates, RIPE holders will wield comprehensive protocol control:

### Core Protocol Parameters
- **Risk Management**: Collateral ratios, liquidation thresholds, stability fees
- **Asset Integration**: New collateral approval, oracle selection, risk tiers
- **Economic Policy**: Interest rate models, fee structures, revenue distribution
- **System Limits**: Debt ceilings, deposit caps, exposure limits

### Treasury Operations
- **[Endaoment](11-endaoment.md) Strategy**: Yield deployment across DeFi protocols
- **Partnership Terms**: Liquidity partnerships and revenue sharing
- **Capital Allocation**: Investment priorities and risk tolerance
- **Emergency Response**: Crisis management and recovery procedures

### Protocol Evolution
- **Technical Upgrades**: Smart contract improvements and new features
- **Incentive Design**: Reward distributions and emission schedules
- **Governance Rules**: Voting parameters and proposal requirements
- **Strategic Direction**: Long-term vision and growth initiatives

## Why This Matters

Ripe's governance model creates a unique dynamic where patience and commitment translate directly into protocol control. Unlike typical DeFi governance where wealthy actors can buy influence instantly, our time-weighted system ensures those who've supported the protocol longest have the strongest voice.

This isn't just about voting — it's about building a sustainable, community-driven protocol where incentives align perfectly. Lock your RIPE, accumulate your power, and help shape the future of decentralized stablecoins.

# RIPE Tokenomics: Aligning Incentives for Long-Term Success

RIPE is the governance token that powers Ripe Protocol, with a carefully designed distribution model that prioritizes community ownership while ensuring sustainable development. With a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens and transparent on-chain vesting, RIPE creates alignment between users, contributors, and the protocol's long-term success.

> **📊 Tokenomics at a Glance**
> - **Fixed supply**: 1B RIPE (mint beyond cap only if RIPE Bonds are triggered to cover bad debt)
> - **Community first**: 25% of supply goes to user incentives; this is the only bucket that begins unlocking at TGE via block rewards & bonding
> - **All unlocks on-chain**: Immutable vesting contracts you can audit today

For a deep dive into how RIPE powers the protocol—including [staking rewards](06-ripe-rewards.md), protocol fees via [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md), [governance participation](08-governance.md), and value accrual through [bonds](10-bonds.md)—explore these detailed guides. Full onchain governance will launch post-TGE once the community owns sufficient supply.

## Token Allocation: Community-First Distribution

The 1 billion RIPE supply is allocated across five key stakeholder groups, with the largest portion dedicated to community incentives:

![RIPE Token Allocation](https://miro.medium.com/v2/format:webp/1*2OWDZIl3gjqJl_B6JXyyaw.png)

### Community Incentives (25% - 250M RIPE)
Block rewards, bonding discounts, and LP rewards that directly incentivize protocol usage and growth. This is the only allocation that begins distributing at TGE.

### Ripe Foundation Treasury (22.2% - 222M RIPE)
Long-term liquidity provisions, strategic partnerships, ecosystem grants, and marketing initiatives to ensure protocol sustainability.

### Core Contributors (20.6% - 206M RIPE)
Compensation for 2.5 years of full-time protocol development already completed, plus ongoing development through the 4-year vesting period, ensuring the team remains committed to building and improving the protocol.

### Distribution Partner - Hightop (15% - 150M RIPE)
Strategic partner providing mobile on-ramps and fiat bridges to bring Ripe Protocol to mainstream users beyond crypto natives.

### Early Backers (17.2% - 172M RIPE)
Seed investors who provided capital and strategic guidance during testnet development, helping accelerate the path to mainnet launch.

## Emission Schedule: Sustainable Token Release

![RIPE Emission Schedule](https://miro.medium.com/v2/format:webp/1*_cx_OWu-kZAygnVZeLI5Cw.png)

### Hard Cap with Emergency Provision

The RIPE supply is strictly capped at 1 billion tokens with one carefully designed exception: if the protocol ever needs to cover bad debt that exceeds treasury reserves, it can auction [RIPE Bonds](10-bonds.md) to raise funds. These emergency tokens would be minted beyond the cap, transparently diluting all holders to socialize losses fairly.

### Vesting Schedules by Category

Community Incentives stand alone as the only allocation unlocking from day one, ensuring immediate protocol activity:

**Community Incentives (Unlocking Now)**
- **First Unlock**: Immediate at TGE
- **Release Length**: 5+ years
- **Pattern**: Dynamic distribution via block rewards, bonding discounts, and governance

**Core Contributors (Locked First Year)**
- **First Unlock**: 12 months from TGE
- **Total Length**: 4 years
- **Release Pattern**: 25% unlocked at month 12, then linear vesting over 36 months
- **Example**: A contributor with 1M RIPE allocation receives 250K at month 12, then ~694 RIPE per day

**Ripe Foundation, Distribution Partner & Early Backers (Aligned Schedules)**
- **First Unlock**: 12 months from TGE
- **Total Length**: 3 years
- **Release Pattern**: 33% unlocked at month 12, then linear vesting over 24 months
- **Example**: An early backer with 1M RIPE receives 330K at month 12, then ~931 RIPE per day

## Early Backers: Bootstrap to Launch

### Capital Efficiency Through Self-Funding

Ripe Protocol represents a new model for DeFi development—bootstrapped primarily by its builders. Since committing [full-time](https://medium.com/hightop/hightop-sunset-ripe-sunrise-b2559ff9a7e4) to the protocol, the team has deployed $1.87M in capital:

**Core Contributor Funding**: $1.32M
- Self-funded by the founding team
- Covered operational expenses, legal structure, and security audits
- Demonstrates deep personal commitment to the protocol's success

**Seed Round**: $550K (February 2025)
- Raised via Ripe Foundation at $0.02 per RIPE
- Implied fully diluted valuation: $20M
- First external capital after 2+ years of development
- Funds ongoing operational expenses and launch preparation

### Strategic Seed Investors

The seed round brought together a carefully selected group of strategic partners who share the vision for sustainable DeFi:

**Institutional Partners**
- **[OrangeDAO](https://www.orangedao.xyz/)**: YCombinator alumni network (also advisor allocation)
- **[Big Brain](https://www.bigbrain.holdings/)**: Crypto-Native VC
- **[Tetranode](https://x.com/Tetranode)**: Prominent DeFi investor/whale

**Individual Strategic Investors**
- **Sid Krommenhoek**: Partner at [Album VC](https://www.album.vc/)
- **Stephen McKeon**: Partner at [Collab+Currency](https://www.collabcurrency.com/)
- **Trevor Koverko**: Founder of [Sapien](https://www.sapien.io/)
- **Doug Leonard**: Founder of [HiFi Finance](https://hifi.finance/)
- **AJ Taylor**: Founder of [Etherfuse](https://www.etherfuse.com/)

These early supporters bring diverse perspectives from across DeFi, helping guide the protocol's development while sharing in its long-term success through aligned vesting schedules.

## How Vesting Works: Immutable Smart Contracts

### Smart Contract Automation

Unlike traditional vesting that relies on lawyers and spreadsheets, Ripe Protocol enforces all token distributions entirely onchain. Each contributor, foundation member, and investor receives a personalized smart contract that:

- **Automatically calculates** vested tokens using linear formulas
- **Enables claiming** anytime after cliff periods pass
- **Locks tokens** in governance vault for continued participation
- **Enforces terms** immutably without any manual intervention

### The Vesting Process

**1. Token Release**
```
Vested Amount = Total Allocation × (Time Elapsed / Vesting Duration)
```
Tokens vest continuously—every block brings contributors closer to their full allocation.

**2. Claiming Tokens**
- Contributors can claim vested RIPE anytime (daily, monthly, or in bulk)
- Claimed tokens are minted and deposited into the [Governance Vault](08-governance.md)
- Tokens remain locked but gain full voting power immediately

**3. Unlocking for Transfer**
- After the unlock period (varies by group), tokens become transferable
- Two-phase security process: initiate → wait → confirm
- Protects against compromised accounts and hasty decisions

### Transparency & Security

Every vesting contract is visible onchain, allowing anyone to verify:
- Total allocation and vesting schedule
- Tokens claimed vs. remaining
- Exact unlock dates
- No hidden terms or backdoors

The protocol can freeze contracts in emergencies but cannot steal vested tokens. If someone leaves early, unvested tokens return to treasury while vested amounts remain claimable—ensuring fairness for all parties.

### Why This Matters

Onchain vesting creates unprecedented alignment:
- **No trust required**: Code enforces terms, not promises
- **Immediate participation**: Vested tokens can vote from day one
- **Perfect transparency**: Every token movement tracked publicly
- **Automated fairness**: Same rules for founders and investors

For deep technical details on the vesting system, see the [Contributor contract documentation](../technical/modules/Contributor.md).

## Summary: Tokenomics That Work

RIPE's tokenomics demonstrate that sustainable DeFi is possible without compromising on decentralization or fairness:

- **Fixed Supply**: 1 billion cap maintains scarcity
- **Community First**: Largest unlocking allocation goes to users
- **Transparent Vesting**: Every schedule visible on-chain
- **Aligned Incentives**: Multi-year lockups for all insiders
- **Emergency Provision**: Bad debt mechanism protects protocol
- **Strategic Funding**: Efficient capital raise at fair valuation

As Ripe Protocol grows from launch to maturity, RIPE tokens will flow to those who contribute most—whether through providing liquidity, participating in governance, or building on the platform. This isn't just tokenomics; it's the foundation for a new financial system built on transparency, efficiency, and community ownership.

Ripe Bonds create a powerful exchange mechanism where your stablecoins transform into RIPE tokens while funding the protocol's [Endaoment](11-endaoment.md) treasury. This isn't just a token sale — it's a strategic partnership where early supporters help build the financial foundation that makes [GREEN](01-green-stablecoin.md) stable and the entire protocol sustainable.

## The Bond Value Proposition

### Why Bonds Matter

Bonds solve a critical challenge in DeFi: how to bootstrap protocol-owned liquidity without relying on mercenary capital or unsustainable incentives. Through bonds, Ripe Protocol:

- **Accumulates permanent treasury assets** that generate yield forever
- **Creates deep liquidity** for GREEN trading without renting it
- **Distributes RIPE fairly** based on actual capital contribution
- **Aligns incentives** between token holders and protocol health

Every bond purchase directly strengthens the protocol while rewarding participants with discounted RIPE tokens.

## Bond Mechanics: How It Works

### Epoch-Based Distribution

Bonds operate through time-limited epochs that ensure sustainable token distribution:

- **Fixed Supply Per Epoch**: Limited RIPE available prevents oversupply
- **Time Windows**: Each epoch runs 12-24 hours typically
- **Fair Access**: First-come, first-served within each epoch
- **Auto-Renewal**: New epochs can start automatically after sell-out

This system prevents whales from capturing entire allocations while ensuring consistent availability for all participants.

### Dynamic Pricing That Rewards Action

Within each epoch, RIPE prices follow a descending curve:

```
Start of Epoch → Higher Price → Less RIPE per Dollar
                      ↓
                 Time Passes
                      ↓
End of Epoch → Lower Price → More RIPE per Dollar
```

This creates interesting dynamics:
- **Early birds** get certainty of availability
- **Patient buyers** receive better prices
- **Market forces** determine actual demand
- **Transparent pricing** visible to all participants

### Token Allocation

**150 million RIPE** (15% of total supply) allocated to bonding is expected to be distributed over approximately 5 years, ensuring sustainable treasury growth without overwhelming the market. This measured approach allows the protocol to build substantial reserves while maintaining healthy token economics.

## Maximizing Your Bond Value

### Base Bond Rate

Every bond starts with a base exchange rate determined by:
- **Current epoch progress** (0-100%)
- **Price range** set by governance
- **Payment asset** (typically USDC)

The smart contract calculates your exact RIPE allocation based on these parameters, ensuring transparent and predictable pricing.

### Lock Duration Bonuses

Committing to lock your RIPE dramatically increases your bond value through percentage-based bonuses:

**The Lock Bonus Scale:**
```
No Lock → 0% bonus → 1x RIPE (base amount only)
3 Months → ~15% bonus → 1.15x total RIPE
6 Months → ~35% bonus → 1.35x total RIPE  
1 Year → ~65% bonus → 1.65x total RIPE
2 Years → ~130% bonus → 2.3x total RIPE
3 Years → 200% bonus → 3x total RIPE
```

**How It Works:**
- Choose your lock duration when bonding (0 to 3 years)
- Bonus calculated as percentage of base bond amount
- Locked RIPE automatically deposits into [Ripe Governance Vault](08-governance.md)
- Start earning governance points and staking rewards immediately
- Maintain full voting rights throughout lock period

**Strategic Consideration**: Longer locks mean larger positions but less liquidity. Balance your RIPE accumulation goals with capital flexibility needs.

### Bond Boosters

The protocol rewards specific user activities through Bond Boosters, creating targeted incentives for valuable contributions:

**How Bond Boosters Work:**
- **Automatic Application**: Bond Boosters activate automatically during bond purchases
- **Unit-Based Limits**: Each user has a maximum number of "units" they can boost
- **Time Windows**: Bond Boosters expire at specific block numbers
- **Percentage Multipliers**: Bond Boosters add percentage bonuses to base bond amount

**Current Bond Booster Programs:**
- **Ripe Radness**: Rewards testnet participants
  - Bond Booster range: 10% to 200% based on contribution level
  - Top contributors receive maximum 200% Bond Booster
  - Most participants receive between 10-100% Bond Booster
  - Limited units per participant
  - Expires at predetermined block
  - Eligibility verified through Discord roles

**The Unit System:**
Units represent your Bond Booster capacity:
- 1 unit = 1 USDC
- If you have 1,000 units and 200% Bond Booster:
  - Bond 500 USDC → uses 500 units, get 200% Bond Booster
  - Bond 1,500 USDC → first 1,000 get Bond Booster, remaining 500 don't
- Units consumed permanently (no refills)

**Stacking Example:**
Top-tier testnet participant bonds 1,000 USDC with 3-year lock:
- Base: 2,000 RIPE (at $0.50/RIPE)
- Lock bonus: +4,000 RIPE (200% of base)
- Radness Bond Booster: +4,000 RIPE (200% of base for top contributors)
- **Total: 10,000 RIPE (5x multiplier)**

*Note: Most participants receive smaller Bond Boosters. With a 50% Radness Bond Booster, total would be 7,000 RIPE (3.5x multiplier)*

## Real-World Bonding Examples

### Example 1: The Committed Builder
*Sarah bonds 5,000 USDC with maximum commitment*

- **Epoch Status**: 7 hours into 24-hour epoch (30% complete)
- **Base Rate**: $0.40 per RIPE → 12,500 RIPE base
- **3-Year Lock**: +200% → 25,000 RIPE bonus
- **Radness Bond Booster**: +200% → 25,000 RIPE bonus
- **Total Received**: 62,500 RIPE (locked 3 years)
- **Effective Price**: $0.08 per RIPE

### Example 2: The Flexible Investor
*James bonds 10,000 USDC with moderate lock*

- **Epoch Status**: 17 hours into 24-hour epoch (70% complete)
- **Base Rate**: $0.25 per RIPE → 40,000 RIPE base
- **6-Month Lock**: +35% → 14,000 RIPE bonus
- **No Bond Booster**: 0 RIPE bonus
- **Total Received**: 54,000 RIPE (locked 6 months)
- **Effective Price**: $0.185 per RIPE

### Example 3: The Liquid Participant
*Maya bonds 2,000 USDC with no lock*

- **Epoch Status**: 6 hours into 12-hour epoch (50% complete)
- **Base Rate**: $0.35 per RIPE → 5,714 RIPE base
- **No Lock**: 0% bonus
- **No Bond Booster**: 0 RIPE bonus
- **Total Received**: 5,714 RIPE (immediately liquid)
- **Effective Price**: $0.35 per RIPE

## Understanding Bad Debt Mechanics

When protocol liquidations create bad debt, bonds help restore system health:

**What Happens to Your Bond:**
- You receive **100% of your calculated RIPE** — no reduction
- Your payment helps clear bad debt from the system
- Protocol health improves with every bond purchase

**The Supply Impact:**
- RIPE allocated to cover bad debt gets minted **beyond the 1 billion cap**
- For example: If 1M RIPE covers bad debt, total supply becomes 1.001 billion
- This extra minting dilutes all RIPE holders proportionally
- Protocol tracks exactly how much additional RIPE was minted for transparency

**Why This Design:**
- Ensures bondholders always receive their full allocation
- Distributes bad debt cost fairly across all token holders
- Maintains bond attractiveness during protocol stress
- Creates incentive for governance to minimize bad debt

This mechanism ensures bonds remain attractive while helping the protocol recover from market stress — a win-win for participants and system stability.

## Where Your Bond Payment Goes

Every stablecoin from bond sales flows directly to the [Endaoment](11-endaoment.md), transforming into productive protocol assets:

**Treasury Deployment Strategy:**
- **Yield Farming**: Earns returns across DeFi via Underscore Protocol integrations
- **GREEN Liquidity**: Provides permanent trading depth for the stablecoin
- **Market Operations**: Defends GREEN's $1 peg during volatility
- **Strategic Reserves**: Backstops the protocol during extreme events

**The Flywheel Effect:**
```
Your Bonds → Treasury Growth → More Yield → Stronger Protocol
     ↑                                              ↓
     └────── Higher RIPE Value ← Better GREEN ←────┘
```

Unlike protocols that waste treasury on temporary incentives, every bond dollar becomes permanent productive capital working 24/7 for protocol sustainability.

## The Bottom Line

Ripe Bonds offer a unique opportunity to acquire RIPE tokens while directly funding the protocol's success. Through dynamic pricing, lock bonuses, and activity rewards, committed participants can accumulate significant positions at attractive valuations. 

Every bond strengthens the Endaoment treasury, deepens GREEN liquidity, and builds a more sustainable protocol — creating value for all participants while rewarding those who contribute capital when it matters most.

# The Endaoment: Ripe Protocol's Autonomous Treasury

The Endaoment is Ripe Protocol's self-sustaining treasury system that transforms stablecoin deposits from [bond sales](10-bonds.md) into productive capital that works perpetually for the protocol. Think of it as an intelligent treasury that never sleeps — automatically defending [GREEN](01-green-stablecoin.md)'s dollar peg, generating yield across DeFi, and growing the protocol's financial strength without human intervention.

## Why The Endaoment Exists

Traditional DeFi protocols face a critical challenge: they must choose between maintaining large idle treasuries for stability or deploying capital for growth. The Endaoment solves this dilemma by creating a dynamic treasury that:

1. **Actively grows protocol wealth** through sophisticated yield strategies
2. **Defends GREEN's stability** with algorithmic market operations
3. **Operates autonomously** without manual treasury management
4. **Creates sustainable revenue** that benefits all protocol participants

## How Value Flows Through The Endaoment

### The Treasury Flywheel

```
Bond Sales → Treasury Growth → Yield Generation → Protocol Strength
     ↑                                                      ↓
     └────────── More User Confidence ←─────────────────┘
```

Every stablecoin that enters through [bond sales](10-bonds.md) becomes productive capital that:
- Earns yield across multiple DeFi protocols
- Provides liquidity for GREEN trading
- Backs the protocol during market stress
- Funds operations without token inflation

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent GREEN Stabilization

The Endaoment acts as GREEN's guardian, maintaining its $1 peg through automated market operations:

**The 50/50 Rule**: The system monitors GREEN's ratio in Curve pools, targeting perfect balance with paired stablecoins.

**When GREEN Weakens** (trades below $1):
- Detects when GREEN exceeds 50% of the pool
- Removes excess GREEN liquidity
- Burns GREEN to create scarcity
- Market forces push price back to $1

**When GREEN Strengthens** (trades above $1):
- Detects when GREEN falls below 50% of the pool
- Adds GREEN liquidity to increase supply
- May mint new GREEN (tracked as debt)
- Market forces bring price back to $1

This creates a self-balancing system where GREEN maintains its peg without manual intervention.

### 2. Multi-Strategy Yield Engine

The Endaoment leverages **Underscore Protocol** — an advanced infrastructure that provides standardized integrations (called "Legos") with DeFi protocols. This partnership enables both programmatic treasury management today and AI-driven optimization in the future.

**How Underscore Powers the Endaoment:**
- **Unified Interface**: Every yield strategy uses the same standardized commands, whether deploying to Aave or Uniswap
- **Registry-Based Discovery**: New protocol integrations automatically become available without contract upgrades
- **AI-Ready Architecture**: Designed from day one to enable AI agents to analyze and execute complex treasury strategies
- **Gas Optimization**: Batch operations across multiple protocols in single transactions

**Active Strategies Include:**
- **Lending Protocols**: Earning interest on Aave, Morpho, Euler, Fluid, Compound
- **Automated Market Makers**: Providing liquidity on Aerodrome, Uniswap, Curve
- **Liquid Staking**: Capturing ETH staking rewards
- **Concentrated Liquidity**: Maximizing capital efficiency

**Smart Allocation**: The system continuously optimizes between strategies based on:
- Real-time yield comparisons
- Risk-adjusted returns
- Liquidity needs
- Market conditions

**Future AI Integration**: While currently operating through programmatic rules, the Endaoment's architecture is built to support AI treasury managers that could dynamically rebalance across integrated protocols, finding optimal yield opportunities 24/7.

### 3. Strategic Partnership Programs

The Endaoment enables win-win liquidity partnerships:

**For Partners:**
- Co-invest alongside protocol treasury
- Share in liquidity provision rewards
- Reduce impermanent loss through diversification
- Access protocol-generated GREEN liquidity

**For Ripe Protocol:**
- Deepen liquidity without dilution
- Establish ecosystem relationships
- Expand market presence
- Generate additional revenue streams

## The Value Proposition

### For GREEN Users

**Unshakeable Stability**: The Endaoment's automated interventions ensure GREEN maintains its dollar peg even during market turbulence. This isn't just a promise — it's mathematically enforced by smart contracts.

**Deep Liquidity**: Treasury-owned liquidity means you can trade GREEN with minimal slippage, whether you're swapping $100 or $100,000.

**Sustainable Backing**: Every GREEN is backed by productive assets generating real yield, not just idle reserves.

### For RIPE Holders

**Growing Treasury**: Bond proceeds don't sit idle — they work 24/7 across DeFi generating returns that strengthen the protocol.

**Non-Dilutive Revenue**: Treasury yields fund operations and rewards without minting new tokens.

**Compounding Value**: As the treasury grows, so does the protocol's ability to generate yield, creating a virtuous cycle.

### For sGREEN Stakers

**Stability Rewards**: [sGREEN](04-sgreen.md) stakers earn rewards from providing stability to the [GREEN](01-green-stablecoin.md) ecosystem through the [stability pool](05-stability-pools.md) mechanism.

**Protected Participation**: Your staked position helps maintain protocol health while earning returns from liquidation premiums.

### Future Yield Distribution

Currently, all treasury earnings remain in the Endaoment to maximize protocol growth and compound returns. However, [governance](08-governance.md) retains the power to enable yield distribution in the future, which could direct treasury earnings to:

- **RIPE stakers** in the [governance vault](08-governance.md) — rewarding long-term aligned participants
- **[sGREEN](04-sgreen.md) stakers** — providing additional rewards beyond [stability pool](05-stability-pools.md) returns

When activated, these would represent real yield from treasury operations, not token inflation, creating sustainable value for committed protocol participants.

## What Sets The Endaoment Apart

Unlike traditional protocol treasuries that require constant human management, the Endaoment operates as an autonomous financial engine. It doesn't just hold assets — it actively manages them to:

1. **Generate sustainable yield** without taking excessive risks
2. **Defend GREEN's stability** through market-based mechanisms
3. **Grow protocol wealth** in both bull and bear markets
4. **Operate transparently** with all actions verifiable on-chain

## The Bottom Line

The Endaoment transforms idle treasury assets into a productive force that benefits every protocol participant. By combining automated market operations, diversified yield strategies, and strategic partnerships, it creates a self-reinforcing system where:

- **Users** get a stable, liquid GREEN token
- **Holders** benefit from a growing, productive treasury
- **Stakers** earn real yield from treasury operations
- **Partners** access mutually beneficial opportunities

This isn't just a treasury — it's the financial backbone that enables Ripe Protocol to grow sustainably while maintaining the stability users demand.

# Price Oracles: Your Assets, Accurately Valued

In DeFi, accurate pricing is everything. A lending protocol is only as reliable as its price feeds — stale or manipulated prices can trigger unfair liquidations, enable exploits, or break core functionality. Ripe Protocol takes pricing seriously with a sophisticated multi-oracle system that prioritizes accuracy, resilience, and transparency.

## Why Pricing Matters in Ripe

Every critical protocol operation depends on accurate pricing:

- **Borrowing Power**: Your collateral value determines how much GREEN you can borrow
- **Liquidation Safety**: Price movements trigger liquidations when positions become risky
- **Redemption Values**: Direct redemptions exchange GREEN for exactly $1 of collateral
- **Stability Pool Profits**: Liquidation discounts are calculated from current market prices
- **Interest Rates**: Dynamic rates respond to GREEN's market price

With so much at stake, we've built a pricing system that's both robust and transparent.

## The Multi-Oracle Advantage

Instead of relying on a single price feed, Ripe aggregates multiple independent oracle providers:

```
Asset Price Request Flow:

Your Asset (e.g., ETH)
    ↓
Price Desk (Aggregator)
    ↓
1. Check Priority Oracles (Chainlink first)
2. If no price, check secondary oracles
3. Return first valid price found
    ↓
Accurate USD Value
```

This design provides several benefits:

- **No Single Point of Failure**: If Chainlink goes down, Pyth can provide prices
- **Asset Flexibility**: Different oracles support different assets
- **Cost Optimization**: Use expensive oracles only for critical assets
- **Future-Proof**: New oracle providers can be added seamlessly

## Our Oracle Providers

### 1. Chainlink (Primary)

The industry standard for decentralized price feeds:

- **Coverage**: Major crypto assets (ETH, BTC, stablecoins, blue chips)
- **Reliability**: Battle-tested across DeFi with billions secured
- **Update Frequency**: Varies by asset based on volatility
- **Trust Model**: Decentralized node operators with reputation

Chainlink serves as our primary oracle for most mainstream assets due to its proven track record and wide deployment.

### 2. Curve Pools (Specialized)

Direct pricing from the largest stablecoin liquidity pools:

- **Coverage**: Stablecoins, Curve LP tokens, GREEN pairs
- **Reliability**: Based on actual tradeable liquidity
- **Special Feature**: Monitors GREEN's peg in real-time
- **Trust Model**: On-chain AMM state, manipulation-resistant

**Critical for GREEN Stability**: The Curve price feed maintains the "Green Reference Pool" data that directly impacts [dynamic interest rates](03-borrowing.md#dynamic-interest-rates-emergency-mechanism-only). By taking weighted snapshots of the GREEN/USDC pool balance over time, the protocol can detect when GREEN trades below peg and automatically adjust borrowing costs to restore balance. This creates a powerful feedback loop — when GREEN weakens, higher rates incentivize borrowers to buy GREEN for repayment, strengthening the peg.

### 3. Pyth Network (High-Frequency)

Sub-second price updates from institutional providers:

- **Coverage**: Wide range including stocks, forex, commodities, and crypto
- **Reliability**: Professional market makers provide data
- **Update Frequency**: Can update every slot if needed
- **Trust Model**: Aggregated from multiple institutional sources

Useful for assets requiring frequent updates or those not covered by Chainlink.

### 4. Stork Network (Emerging)

Next-generation oracle with unique features:

- **Coverage**: Growing selection of DeFi assets
- **Reliability**: Novel cryptographic attestation model
- **Update Frequency**: On-demand with nanosecond precision
- **Trust Model**: Decentralized publishers with stakes

Provides additional redundancy and supports newer assets.

### 5. Blue Chip Yield Prices (Specialized)

Custom pricing for yield-bearing tokens from major protocols:

- **Coverage**: aTokens (Aave), cTokens (Compound), Morpho positions, Euler, etc.
- **Reliability**: Direct integration with protocol contracts
- **Special Feature**: Handles rebasing and yield accrual correctly
- **Trust Model**: Based on underlying protocol's accounting

**Two-Layer Pricing**: This oracle combines real-time underlying asset prices (from Chainlink or other primary oracles) with weighted snapshots of the share price/exchange rate. For example, to price a Morpho USDC position:
- **Underlying USDC price**: Fetched in real-time from Chainlink ($1.00)
- **Morpho share price**: Weighted average over time (e.g., 1.05 USDC per share)
- **Final position value**: $1.00 × 1.05 = $1.05 per share

**Manipulation Protection**: Only the exchange rate uses weighted snapshots — the underlying asset price remains current. This prevents attackers from manipulating the yield token's exchange rate through flash loans or temporary spikes, while ensuring the collateral responds immediately to market movements in the underlying asset. The snapshots also include upside deviation throttling for the exchange rate, gradually incorporating sudden appreciation rather than accepting it immediately.

## Staleness Protection

Stale prices are dangerous. Here's how we prevent them:

### Global Staleness Threshold
- Default: 3600 seconds (1 hour) for most assets
- Stricter limits for volatile assets
- Relaxed for stable assets like USDC

### Per-Oracle Configuration
Each oracle can have custom staleness limits:
- Chainlink: Uses round timestamp
- Pyth/Stork: Uses publish timestamp  
- Curve: Always current (reads directly from pool state)
- Blue Chip: Snapshot-based with minimum delays

### What Happens When Prices Go Stale?

1. **Primary Oracle Stale**: System automatically checks secondary oracles
2. **All Oracles Stale**: Operations can be configured to either:
   - Use last known price (for non-critical operations)
   - Revert transaction (for critical operations like liquidations)
3. **No Feed Available**: New assets without feeds cannot be borrowed against

## Price Priority System

Not all oracles are created equal. Our priority system ensures the best price source is used:

```
Priority Order (Configurable):
1. Chainlink (most trusted for major assets)
2. Curve Pools (for stablecoins and LP tokens)
3. Pyth Network (backup for Chainlink assets)
4. Stork Network (additional redundancy)
5. Blue Chip Yield (for yield-bearing tokens)
```

Governance can adjust priorities based on:
- Oracle reliability track record
- Gas costs for updates
- Asset-specific considerations
- Market conditions

## Security Measures

### Time-Locked Changes
- New oracle additions: 24-hour delay
- Oracle priority changes: 12-hour delay  
- Feed updates: 6-hour delay
- Emergency disables: Instant (governance multisig)

### Fail-Safe Mechanisms
- Automatic fallback to secondary oracles
- Pause functionality for compromised feeds
- Fund recovery for stuck update fees
- Governance override capabilities

## The Bottom Line

Ripe Protocol's multi-oracle system provides the most resilient and accurate pricing infrastructure in DeFi. By aggregating multiple independent price sources, implementing staleness protection, and maintaining transparent priority systems, we ensure your assets are always valued fairly. This robust foundation enables confident borrowing, safe liquidations, and reliable protocol operations — because in DeFi, accurate prices aren't just numbers, they're the foundation of trust.
