# Ripe Protocol: Where Your Entire Portfolio Becomes Productive Capital

Welcome to Ripe Protocol — a lending platform that transforms how DeFi handles collateral. Instead of juggling multiple isolated positions, your entire portfolio works as one, backing a single loan with the combined strength of all your assets.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional DeFi lending forces impossible choices:

**Isolated Positions** (MakerDAO, Liquity)

- ETH vault here, WBTC vault there
- Each position managed separately
- Liquidation cascades risk your entire portfolio

**Pooled Risk** (Aave, Compound)

- Your collateral backs everyone's loans
- Limited to "safe" blue-chip assets
- One bad actor affects all users

**Fragmented Markets** (Morpho, Euler)

- Better rates but still isolated positions
- Each market needs its own liquidity
- Innovation limited by conservative parameters

## The Ripe Solution: Unified Multi-Collateral Lending

```
Your Portfolio:              Traditional:           Ripe:
┌─────────────┐             ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│ 5 ETH       │ ──────────> │ ETH Loan #1 │       │             │
│ 2 WBTC      │ ──────────> │ WBTC Loan #2│       │  ONE LOAN   │
│ 10K USDC    │ ──────────> │ USDC Loan #3│  ───> │  GREEN      │
│ stETH       │ ──────────> │ Can't use   │       │  All Assets │
│ NFTs        │ ──────────> │ Can't use   │       │  Working    │
└─────────────┘             └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
                            5 positions to          1 unified
                            manage, limited         position,
                            assets                  everything works
```
