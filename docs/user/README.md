## Key Concepts

### Multi-Collateral Innovation
Unlike traditional lending protocols that create separate loans for each collateral type, Ripe allows you to combine multiple assets into a single, unified loan position with better overall terms.

### GREEN Stablecoin
The protocol's native stablecoin, overcollateralized and maintained at $1 through multiple stability mechanisms including dynamic interest rates, direct redemptions, and the Endaoment treasury.

### Three-Phase Liquidation
A sophisticated system that attempts the least impactful liquidation methods first:
1. Internal recovery (burning GREEN/sGREEN, Endaoment transfers)
2. Stability pool swaps at controlled discounts
3. Dutch auctions as the final mechanism

### Yield Generation
Multiple ways to earn:
- Hold sGREEN for automatic protocol revenue sharing
- Participate in stability pools for liquidation premiums
- Provide liquidity with GREEN pairs

## Safety First

- Always maintain adequate collateralization buffers
- Monitor your Debt Health regularly
- Understand liquidation mechanics before borrowing
- Start small and increase positions gradually
