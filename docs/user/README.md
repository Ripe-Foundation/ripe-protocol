# Ripe Protocol: One Loan. Every Asset. Maximum Power.

DeFi lending is broken. Five vaults for five assets. Can't use your tokenized stocks. Yield tokens sit idle. 

Ripe fixes this. Your entire portfolio — crypto, RWAs, tokenized securities, everything — backs ONE loan. Finally, borrowing that understands what a portfolio actually is.

## The Problem: DeFi Thinks Your Assets Live in Silos

**Isolated Vaults** (MakerDAO, Liquity)
ETH in one vault. WBTC in another. Five assets? Five loans. Five liquidation risks. It's 2025 and we're still pretending portfolios don't exist.

**Shared Risk Pools** (Aave, Compound)  
Your ETH backs someone else's degen trade. Their bad debt? Your problem. Oh, and forget about using tokenized stocks or treasury bills.

**"Innovation" That Isn't** (Morpho, Euler)
Slightly better rates. Same old isolation. Each market fragments liquidity further. The future looks exactly like the past.

## The Ripe Solution: Unified Multi-Collateral Lending

```
Your Portfolio:              Traditional:           Ripe:
┌─────────────┐             ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│ 5 ETH       │ ──────────> │ ETH Loan #1 │       │             │
│ 2 WBTC      │ ──────────> │ WBTC Loan #2│       │  ONE LOAN   │
│ 10K USDC    │ ──────────> │ USDC Loan #3│  ───> │  GREEN      │
│ RWA tokens  │ ──────────> │ Can't use   │       │  All Assets │
│ T-bills     │ ──────────> │ Can't use   │       │  Working    │
└─────────────┘             └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
                            5 positions to          1 unified
                            manage, limited         position,
                            assets                  everything works

## The Real Vision: Unlocking $16 Trillion

Here's what matters: By 2030, $16 trillion in real-world assets will be tokenized. Stocks. Real estate. Gold. Treasury bills.

Traditional DeFi can't handle them. Too risky. Too different. Too complicated.

Ripe was built for this moment. When your tokenized Tesla shares are as easy to borrow against as your ETH. When that tokenized apartment in São Paulo unlocks liquidity for its owner. When a farmer in Guatemala can finally access capital using tokenized land.

Every other protocol is fighting over the same $500B in crypto. We're building for the $16 trillion that's coming.

One loan. Every asset. The future of finance.

Welcome to lending that actually makes sense.
